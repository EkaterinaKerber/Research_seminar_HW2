       "['From the time the first website was published in 1991 until today, the internet has profoundly reshaped humanity.  Comparisons between cryptocurrencies and the growth of the internet are invariably drawn (including cryptocurrencies� netscape moment); however, I wanted to test this comparison and see exactly how far along we are.  In this post, I�ll also be exploring the growth of the cryptocurrency market & the early growth of the internet, to see what takeaways we can uncover.  What makes this comparison tough  It�s impossible to know exactly how many people use cryptocurrency and how often because:  * For people who self custodial their cryptocurrencies � people can have multiple wallets for different cryptocurrencies.  * For people who store their cryptocurrencies on exchanges � 1 wallet address does not equate to 1 user on the exchange. It�s also typical for exchanges to create a wallet address for each transaction.  Thus, the only way to get an understanding of the number of users for cryptocurrencies is through approximations.  Measuring cryptocurrency user growth  I tried to approximate cryptocurrency user growth in a few ways:  * Bitcoin & Ethereum wallet growth  * Bitcoin & Ethereum active addresses growth (proxy for DAU)  * User growth of crypto-fiat and crypto-crypto exchanges  * Total cryptocurrency trading volume over time    There are ~24M bitcoin wallet addresses in total. This doesn�t mean there are 24M Bitcoin users because one person can have more than 1 wallet address and it is recommended to generate a new bitcoin address for each transaction sent.  I would consider 24M the upper bound number on the number of bitcoin users worldwide.  In addition to looking at the number of wallets, we can look at the number of active addresses per day. To smooth out this chart, I took a median value of active addresses by month, and plotted it on a log scale:    The highest amount of active addresses we�ve seen per day was ~1.1M addresses � this is an approximation of daily active users (DAU) within the bitcoin network. However, if the main point of Bitcoin is viewed as purely a store of value, then you would assume a much lower DAU vs. any traditional mobile application or website.  We can also do the same analysis for Ethereum, here is the Ethereum address growth and active addresses per day (in log scale):      In total, there are 31M Ethereum addresses with peak daily active addresses on the Ethereum network reaching 1.1M.  Ethereum is a bit different than bitcoin because smart contracts have their own addresses and usage on Ethereum should naturally be higher since Ethereum is designed as a smart contract platform, not as a pure store of value.  Users of bitcoin and users of ethereum are not mutually exclusive as well, I would assume a high degree of correlation between the two cryptocurrencies.  Another method to approximate the user growth of cryptocurrencies is to instead look at the exchanges themselves � both fiat-crypto and crypto-crypto exchanges.  Only a handful of crypto exchanges have published their total user stats & user growth statistics. Here is what I could find:    If we take all of the exchanges trading with fees, here is a breakdown of the market share by all of the crypto exchanges (including fiat and crypto-crypto):    Furthermore, if we take all of the exchanges where we know the user counts and trading volume, we can come up with an estimated trading volume per user. Through this number, we can forecast across all trading volume what the estimated users of cryptocurrencies as a whole are: 20.2M users.  I would consider this the lower bound on the number of cryptocurrency users based on the number of people who are trading & purchasing cryptocurrencies across all of the various exchanges.  Furthermore, we can also look at the overall trading volume of all cryptocurrencies over time to see how trading volume have been trending from 2014�18. The chart below is also in log scale and the values have been averaged out per month to get a better sense of the overall trend line.    While all of these measurements are not exact counts of users, I would approximate the total users of cryptocurrencies to be between 20M-30M people in total worldwide.  Comparing the growth of cryptocurrency users to the growth of internet users  Now that we have an estimate on the total number of cryptocurrency users worldwide, we can look at the growth of the internet and estimate how early we are in this trajectory.  Here is the growth of internet users:    If we zoom into 1990�1995 for the internet compared to 2013�2018 in cryptocurrencies:    You can see we�re actually tracking quite closely with the early days of the internet. If you think cryptocurrencies is going to follow a similar trajectory as the internet, we look like we�re in about year 1994 compared to the internet.  We can also do a similar analysis comparing the number of websites in the early internet to the number of crypto projects in the space � for this I�m taking the total number of cryptocurrencies & tokens + all of the DApps. Here is the growth trajectory of the number of websites:    If we zoom into 1991�1995 in the growth of websites compared to 2014�17 in the growth of crypto assets (tokens which received funding +DApps):    We are at year 1994 on this comparison as well. For one last comparison we can look at the total number of internet companies which received funding from 2014 to 2017 compared to the number of internet startups that got funding from 1991 to 1995.  *Funding amounts are adjusted for inflation and only account for internet/software company financings.    My takeaways:  * Even though we�ve seen a huge increase for number of users of cryptocurrencies, tokens, and DApps � we are still in year 1994 if we compare the trajectory to the growth of the internet.  * However, depending on your long-term view of the core-use cases of blockchains & cryptocurrencies, the analogy is either an apt analogy or a pointless endeavor:  * If you view the core use-cases of cryptocurrencies as a new asset class then I wouldn�t necessarily expect cryptocurrencies to follow the same trajectory as the internet � both in terms of user growth & growth of assets (equivalent to websites on the internet).  * If you view the core use-cases of cryptocurrencies as an application platform for decentralized applications (DApps) � or better known as the decentralized internet � then the growth of users & DApps would be comparable to the growth of internet users & website growth.  My biggest criticism towards the DApp future is we haven�t seen DApp usage keep pace with the number of DApps being created. The current core use cases of cryptocurrencies are speculation, store of value, assets, payments, etc.  Looking at the data we can see the use case of cryptocurrencies as an asset class has considerably more proof points and measurable user adoption. However, the future of decentralized applications, while interesting to track, is still too early to measure.

       " 'Ever since Nas Daily�s video came out about how I earned over $400,000 with less than $10,000 investing in Bitcoin and Ethereum, I�ve been getting hundreds of questions from people around the world about how to get started with cryptocurrency investment.  First: I�m super glad there�s so much interest in cryptocurrency right now. I firmly do believe that cryptocurrency and blockchain technology has the potential to fundamentally change much of the way our world currently operates for the better. It reminds me a lot of the internet in the 90s.  Second: Investment in cryptocurrency isn�t something to be taken lightly. It�s extremely risky, extremely speculative, and extremely early stage still at this point in time. Countless speculators and day traders have lost their entire fortunes trading cryptocurrency. I was no different when I first started investing in crypto. The first $5000 I put into crypto fell almost immediately to less than $500 � a net loss of over 90%.  Third: All of the following words are entirely and solely my own opinion, and do not reflect any objective truth in the world or the opinions or perspective of any other individual or entity. I write them here merely so people can know how I personally approach cryptocurrency, and what I have personally found helpful in my foray into this realm.  I�m firmly of the opinion that one should never invest in something one doesn�t thoroughly understand, so I�m going to split this article into three parts.  The first part will speak to a broad explanation of what bitcoin and cryptocurrency at large are. The second will discuss my personal investment philosophy as it pertains to crypto. The third will show you step by step how to actually begin investing in crypto, if you so choose. Each section will be clearly delineated, so feel free to skip parts if they�re already familiar to you.  Part I: What is Bitcoin? Why is it useful?  Great question. If you want the full story behind the advent of bitcoin, I highly recommend the book Digital Gold. It traces the entire history of bitcoin from its inception all the way up to 2015. It�s an engrossing read, and highly informative.  For now, let�s start with a quick history lesson about bitcoin. Bitcoin was officially unveiled to the public in a white paper published October 31st, 2008. The white paper is actually extremely readable, very short (just 8 pages), and incredibly elegantly written. If you want to understand why bitcoin is so compelling straight from the horse�s mouth, you must read this paper. It will explain everything better than I or anyone else likely ever could.  I won�t delve too much into the technical details of how bitcoin works (which are better elucidated in the white paper), but will instead focus on a broader exploration of its history and implications.  Subpart: The Background Context of Bitcoin  Bitcoin was invented in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, and the crisis was a clear motivating factor for its creation.  Numerous banks and other financial institutions failed across the world, and had to be bailed out by governments at the expense of their taxpayers. This underscored the fragility of the modern financial system, where the health of our monetary system is reliant on banks and other financial institutions that we are forced to trust to make wise and prudent decisions with the money we give them. Too often for comfort, they fail to carry out this fiduciary responsibility to an adequate degree.  Of particular note is fractional reserve banking. When you give a bank $1,000, the bank doesn�t actually keep all that money for you. It goes out and is legally allowed to spend up to $900 of your money, and keep just $100 in the off chance that you ask for your money back.  In the most simplistic case, if you are the only depositor at this bank, and you ask for more than $100 back at once, the bank won�t be able to give you your money, because it doesn�t have it any more.  Shockingly, this is actually how banks work in reality. In the United States, the reserve requirement, or the percentage of net deposits banks are actually required to keep in liquid financial instruments on hand, is generally 10% for most banks. This means that if a bank has net deposits of a billion dollars, it needs to only keep 100 million on hand at any given time.  This is fine most of the time, as generally the customers of that bank won�t all try to cash out at the same time, and the bank is able to stay liquid. However, the moment customers start to question the bank�s financial stability, things can go south very quickly. If just a small number of customers begin asking for all their deposits back, a bank can rapidly become depleted of all its liquid funds.  This leads to what�s known as a bank run, where the bank fails because it is unable to fulfill all the withdrawals customers demand. This can escalate quickly into a systemic bank panic, where multiple banks begin to suffer the same fate. Each successive failure compounds the collective panic, and quite quickly, the whole system can begin to collapse like a house of cards.  This is what led in large part to the Great Depression, for instance. The whole system is fundamentally predicated on trust in the system, and the second that vanishes, everything can go south incredibly quickly.  The financial crisis of 2008 highlighted yet another risk of the modern banking system. When a bank goes out and spends the 90% of net deposits it holds in investments, it can often make very bad bets, and lose all that money. In the case of the 2008 crisis, banks in particular bet on high risk subprime mortgages. These were mortgages taken out by borrowers very likely to become delinquent, to purchase houses that were sharply inflated in value by the rampant ease of acquiring a mortgage.  When those mortgages were defaulted on, the artificially inflated values of the homes began to collapse, and banks were left holding assets worth far less than the amount they had lent out. As a consequence, they now had nowhere near the amount of money that customers had given them, and began experiencing liquidity crises that led to their ultimate bankruptcy and demise.  After the Great Depression occurred, the government attempted to address this issue by creating the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), which technically guarantees all customer deposits in participating banks up to $250,000 per account.  Unfortunately, the FDIC is just as dramatically underfunded as banks are. As the FDIC itself acknowledges, it holds enough money to cover just over 1% of all the deposits it insures. In other words, if banks reneged on any more than 1% of all their deposits, the FDIC itself would also fail, and everyone would yet again be left in the dust without recourse.  In fact, this has already happened. The FDIC used to have a sister corporation that insured savings and loan institutions, as it itself at the time only insured bank deposits, and not savings and loan institution deposits. This was known as the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation, or FSLIC.  In the savings and loan crisis of the 1980s, over 1,000 of the 3,200 savings and loan institutions in the United States failed in rapid succession. The FSLIC almost immediately became insolvent itself, and had to be recapitalized several times with over $25 billion dollars of taxpayer money. Even this didn�t even come close to being sufficient to solve the crisis, and the FSLIC managed to only resolve the failure of less than 300 of the 1000 bankrupt institutions, even with all the handouts from taxpayers, before it just flat out gave up and dissolved itself.  For the most part, things generally work fine on a day to day basis. This belies, however, the true fragility of the system. It�s hard to anticipate these things before they happen, because it�s so easy to fall into the trap of assuming that things will always be as they mostly always have been. If things have been fine yesterday, and the day before, and the few years before that, or even the few decades before that, we just naturally assume that they will continue to be fine for the indefinite future.  History has proven this to be an often fatal assumptive error. The second things start to stop working, they tend to stop working in an extremely rapid, catastrophic fashion. There�s very little, if anything, stopping us from seeing another Great Depression sometime in the future, be it the near or longer term future. When that does happen � and it almost certainly will, sooner or later, if history is any good teacher � those who haven�t adequately prepared for it and taken appropriate prophylactic measures may very well find themselves in a bad spot.  Subpart: Fiat Currencies Compound the Dilemma  Mistrust in fiat currencies, or currencies created and backed solely by faith in a government, both because of the modern banking system and because of the inherent nature of fiat currency, has in large part been why gold has been used as such a reliable store of value over millennia.  Fiat currencies are the world�s predominant form of currency today. The US dollar or the British pound, for instance, are fiat currencies. These are currencies that are entirely controlled in their supply and creation by a national government, and are backed by nothing but faith in that government.  This has proved a mistake countless times throughout history. Zimbabwe is a classic example, where the Zimbabwean dollar, thanks to an incompetent government among other factors, experienced enormous levels of hyperinflation. At one point, inflation was estimated at almost 80 billion percent in just a single month.The following image gives an idea of just how rapidly and absurdly a fiat currency can spiral out of control, once it reaches the point of no return.    Lest we think this an isolated instance, Venezuela is experiencing incredibly similar hyperinflation in the present-day, right this moment. The Venezuelan Bol?var inflated over 800% in 2016, and shows no signs of stopping in 2017.  The US hasn�t been immune to these crises, either. The US began its foray into fiat currency with the issuance of Continental Currency in 1775. Just three years later, Continental Currency was worth less than 20% of its original value. 13 years later, hyperinflation entirely collapsed the currency, and the US had to pass a law guaranteeing that all future currencies would be backed by gold and silver, and that no unbacked currencies could be issued by any state.  In comparison, the early history of the US dollar makes the relative volatility of bitcoin in these first 9 years look like peanuts.  Once adopted out of necessity, the gold standard became part and parcel of US currency, just as it was with most other currencies from around the world. The gold standard removed some of the need to have pure faith in US dollars in of themselves, as it guaranteed that all paper money the US issued would be exchangeable at a fixed rate for gold upon demand.  Naturally, you still had to believe that the government would actually keep enough gold to fulfill all these demands (d?j? vu and foreshadowing, anyone? Any flashbacks to fractional reserve banking yet?), but it was certainly better than nothing.  Gold, unlike fiat currencies, requires no trust and faith in a government to responsibly manage its money supply and other financial dealings in order to believe that it will retain its value well over time. This is because gold has no central authority that controls it and effectively dictates its supply and creation arbitrarily. Gold is fundamentally scarce, and only a small amount of it can be mined every year and added to the whole net supply. To date, the estimated total of all the gold ever mined in the history of humankind is only 165,000 metric tons. To put that in perspective, all that gold wouldn�t even fill up 3.5 Olympic sized swimming pools.  No government, no matter how much they wanted to or needed to, could simply conjure up more gold on demand. Fiat currencies, on the other hand, can and often have been printed on demand by governments whenever they happened to be short on cash and needed a quick infusion.  This printing of more money generally leads to inflation, as the total value of all the money in existence rationally should stay the same, no matter how many dollars are printed. Hence, if more dollars are printed, each dollar is worth fractionally less of the total money supply.  In fact, governments design their currencies and monetary policies to inflate intentionally. This is why $100 US dollars in 1913 (when the government officially started tracking inflation rates) is equivalent to $2,470 dollars today, just over 100 years later.  In fact, the average inflation rate of the US dollar over that time period was about 3.22%. This seems low, but in reality means that prices double just every twenty years. In other words, your money becomes half as valuable if you keep it in US dollars every twenty years. Doesn�t seem ultra cool to me.  Gold, on the other hand, doesn�t inflate like fiat currencies do. That�s because there�s an intrinsically limited supply, and consequently, things tend to cost the same in gold over long periods of time. In fact, 2,000 years ago, Roman centurions were paid about 38.58 ounces of gold. In US dollars today, this comes out to about $48,350. The base salary of a captain in the US army today comes out to just about the same at $48,500.  This makes gold, in many ways, a better store of value based on fundamental principles than fiat currencies over time. You don�t have to trust anyone to trust that your gold will retain its value relatively well across the sands of time.  Unfortunately, the gold standard collapsed multiple times during the 20th century and was ultimately abandoned altogether by almost every nation in the world, because governments effectively played fractional reserve banking with their gold reserves. Who could blame them? It must be irresistibly tempting, knowing that in all likelihood, the vast majority of the time, only a fraction of people will ever want to trade in their dollars for gold. Why hold all that gold when you could hold just a fraction of it and get to spend the rest with no consequences in the short term?  Inevitably, this caught up with each and every government over time. For the United States, the gold standard was suspended in the aftermath of the Great Depression. The Bretton Woods international agreement instituted in the aftermath of World War II restored the gold standard to the US dollar, but this was short lived.  Under the Bretton Woods system, numerous foreign governments held US dollars as an indirect and more convenient method of holding gold, as US dollars were supposedly directly exchangeable at a fixed rate for gold. However, by 1966, gold reserves actually held by the US were already pitifully low, with only $13.2 billion worth of gold being held by the government.  By 1971, other governments had caught on to this, and began demanding the exchange of all their US dollars for gold, as was promised to them. Naturally, the US had nowhere near enough gold to fulfill their promises, and this became a government version of the bank run, essentially.  The US chose instead to fully renege on their promised exchange rate, and announced in what was known as the Nixon shock that the US dollar would no longer be redeemable for gold, and would henceforth be backed solely by faith in the US government (very faith-inspiring, no?).  Almost every nation quickly followed suit, and since then, fiat currencies have been allowed free reign to grow as they please with no accountability whatsoever in how much a government chooses to expand their money supply.  This, thus, requires anyone holding fiat currencies to have extreme trust that their government will manage their money supply responsibly, and not make poor financial decisions that will severely devalue the currency they hold. This compounds with the trust one must hold in the banks in which one deposits their fiat currency, to create an ultimate monetary system that has multiple points of very real possible failure, as history has shown time and again.  Holding gold privately removes the need to trust either of these points of failure in the modern banking system, but comes with its own host of problems. Namely, while gold has proven to be an excellent store of value over time, it is incredibly poor for actual day to day use in the modern economy. To transact with gold is excessively cumbersome and inconvenient. No one would consider walking around with an ounce of gold on them, measuring and shaving off exact portions of gold to pay for a cup of coffee, groceries, or a bus ride. Worse, it�s even more difficult and time consuming to send gold to anyone who isn�t physically in the same exact location as you.  For these reasons among others, fiat currencies have traditionally been preferred for everyday use, despite their many shortcomings and associated inherent risks.  No solution to this tradeoff conundrum has heretofore been discovered, or even necessarily possible. Bitcoin, however, with the aid of recent technological advances (computers and the internet), solves all of these issues. It takes the best of both worlds, and puts it into one beautiful, elegant solution.  Subpart: Bitcoin to the Rescue  Holy long-windedness, batman! 2,700 words later, and we finally get to talking about bitcoin. I�m as relieved as you are. Remind me never to write again.  Bitcoin was designed, essentially, as a better �digital gold�. It incorporates all of the best elements of gold � its inherent scarcity and decentralized nature � and then solves all the shortcomings of gold, in allowing it to be globally transactable in precise denominations extremely quickly.  How does it do this? In short, by emulating gold�s production digitally. Gold is physically mined out of the ground. Bitcoin is also �mined�, but digitally. The production of bitcoin is controlled by code that dictates you must find a specific answer to a given problem in order to unlock new bitcoins.  In technical terms, bitcoin utilizes the same proof-of-work system that Hashcash devised in 1997. This system dictates that one must find an input that when hashed, creates an output with a specific number of preceding zeros, among a few other specific requirements.  This is where the �crypto�, incidentally, in cryptocurrency comes from. Cryptographic hash functions are fundamentally necessary for the functioning of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, as they are one-way functions. One-way functions work such that it is easy to calculate an output given an input, but near impossible to calculate the original input given the output. Hence, cryptographic one-way hash functions enable bitcoin�s proof of work system, as it ensures that it is nigh-impossible for someone to just see the output required to unlock new bitcoins, and calculate in reverse the input that created that output.  Instead, one must essentially brute-force the solution, by trying every single possible input in order to find one that creates an output that satisfies the specified requirements.  Bitcoin is further ingeniously devised to guarantee that on average, new bitcoins are only found every 10 minutes or so. It guarantees this by ensuring that the code that dictates the new creation of bitcoin automatically increases the difficulty of the proof-of-work system in proportion to the number of computers trying to solve the problem at hand.  For instance, in the very beginning of time, it was only the creator of bitcoin who was mining for bitcoins. He used one computer to do so. For simplicity�s sake, let�s assume this one computer could try 1000 different values to hash a second. In a minute, it would hash 60,000 values, and in 10 minutes, 600,000 values.  The algorithm that dictates the mining of bitcoins, therefore, would ensure that on average, it would take 600,000 random tries of hashing values to find one that would fulfill the requirements of the specified output required to unlock the next block of bitcoins.  It can do this by making the problem more or less difficult, by requiring more or less zeros at the beginning of the output that solves the problem. The more zeros that are required at the beginning of the output, the more exponentially difficult the problem becomes to solve. To understand why this is, click here for a reasonably good explanation.  In this case, it would require just the right amount of leading zeros and other characters to ensure that a solution is found on average every 600,000 or so tries.  However, imagine now that a new computer joins the network, and this one too can compute 1000 hashes a second. This effectively doubles the rate at which the problem can be solved, because now on average 600,000 hashes are tried every 5 minutes, not 10.  Bitcoin�s code elegantly solves this problem by ensuring that every 2,016 times new bitcoin is mined (roughly every 14 days at 10 minutes per block), the difficulty adjusts to become proportional to how much more or less hashing power is mining for bitcoin, such that on average new bitcoin continues to be found roughly every ten minutes or so.  You can see the present difficulty of mining bitcoin here. It should be evident from a half-second glance that the amount of computing power working to mine bitcoin right now is immense, and the difficulty is proportionally similarly immense. As of the time of this writing right now, there are close to 5 billion billion hashes per second being run to try to find the next block of bitcoin.  This system holds a lot of advantages even over gold�s natural system of being mined out of the ground. Gold�s mining is effectively random and not dictated by any perfect computer algorithm, and is consequently much more unpredictable in its output at any given moment. If a huge supply of gold is serendipitously found somewhere, it could theoretically dramatically inflate the rate at which gold enters the existing supply, and consequently cause an unanticipated decrease in the unit price of gold.  This isn�t just theoretical � it�s the reality of gold production. This graph illustrates vividly the fact that gold production has been dramatically increasing over time, and is today over four times higher than just a hundred years ago.    In fact, more than half of all the gold that has ever been mined in the history of humankind has been mined in just the past 50 years. The difficulty of mining gold doesn�t proportionally increase with the number of people mining it, or with technological innovations that make it significantly easier to locate and mine gold over time.  Bitcoin, on the other hand, will always be mined on a carefully regulated schedule, because it can perfectly adapt no matter how many people begin to mine it or how technologically advanced bitcoin mining hardware becomes.  In fact, it�s already known for certain that there will only ever be a total of 21 million bitcoins in the world.  This is because the amount of bitcoin that is mined every time a hash problem is solved and a new block is created halves every 210,000 blocks, or roughly every 4 years.  The initial reward per block used to be 50 bitcoins back in 2009. After about four years, this dropped to 25 bitcoins in late 2012. The last halving occurred in July 2016, and dropped the reward per block mined to 12.5. In 2020, this should go down to 6.25, in 2024, 3.125, and so forth, all the way until the reward drops to essentially zero.  When all is said and done, there will hence be 21 million bitcoins. Exactly that, no more, no less. Elegant, no? This eliminates yet another risk with extant currencies, gold included: there are absolutely no surprises when it comes to knowing the present and future supply of bitcoin. A million bitcoin will never be found randomly in California one day and incite a digital gold rush.    The total supply of bitcoin over time. Look how straight the line is getting over time! (Note halvings here too)  On top of this, bitcoin is trivially divisible to any arbitrary degree. Presently, the smallest unit of bitcoin is known as a satoshi, and is one hundred millionth of a single bitcoin (0.00000001 bitcoins = 1 satoshi).  This means that unlike gold, bitcoin is perfectly suited to not only being an inflation-proof store of value, but also a day-to-day transactable currency as well, as it is easily divisible to any arbitrary amount. You can buy a cup of coffee with it just as easily as you can buy a car.  Moreover, bitcoin can be sent incredibly quickly and remotely over the internet to anyone anywhere in the world. This is because when bitcoin is mined, the miners are actually providing a service in powering the bitcoin network.  What happens when a miner mines bitcoin is actually that they add a �block� to what is known as the �blockchain�. The blockchain is a ledger that contains a record of every transaction ever made with bitcoins since its inception. When someone decides to mine bitcoin, they must download the entire blockchain as it presently stands.  Then, when they successfully find a solution to the next hash problem and mine a block of bitcoins, something magical happens. They get to add the block they just mined to the end of the existing blockchain � and with it, they include every transaction that was initiated on the bitcoin network since the last block was mined. They then propagate this block they just created to the rest of the network of bitcoin miners, who all then update their own blockchains with this new block, and begin working on solving the next hash problem.  As a reward for providing this valuable service, miners are allowed to add a single transaction to the beginning of the block they mined, called the �coinbase transaction�. This transaction contains the brand new bitcoin that was created when they mined the block, and allows the miner to claim this bitcoin for themselves.  At this point, a particularly shrewd reader might become concerned with the fact that the reward for mining a new block of bitcoin gradually shrinks to zero. Won�t this cause miners to stop mining bitcoin, and consequently to stop providing the invaluable service that allows the bitcoin network to function and for transactions to be sent?  The answer is no, because miners are not solely rewarded by the new bitcoin that is generated each time they mine a block. Users may also send a transaction fee along with their transactions, which is paid out to any miner who decides to include their transaction in a block they mine. Over time, as the bitcoin network becomes used for more and more transactions, it is expected that transaction fees will be more than sufficient for incentivizing enough miners to continue mining blocks to keep the bitcoin network safe, secure, and robust.  It�s important that enough miners keep trying to mine blocks because this is another valuable service miners provide the network. Bitcoin, like gold, is powerful as a store of value because it is decentralized and trustless. There is no one central authority who holds all the power over bitcoin, just like no central authority holds power over gold.  No one person or government can decide to conjure up more bitcoin on demand, or to take it away. The only way the rules that govern bitcoin can be changed is if the software bitcoin miners run to mine bitcoin is changed.  Technically, any bitcoin miner could decide to change the software they run to mine bitcoin at any time. However, this still doesn�t have any impact on changing bitcoin itself. What it would do is cause a �hard fork�, or a divergence in the block chain.  This occurs because any block that the rogue miner who changed their software mines won�t be accepted by all the other miners who are still running the original software. Consequently, all the other miners will begin mining different blocks, and adding those to their blockchain. This leads to a fork in the road, essentially, where two completely different blockchains are formed � one by the rogue miner, and one by all the other miners.  Everything up to the point of the software change remains the same in both blockchains, but after that change, the blockchains diverge. Once diverged, they can never be reconciled and remerged.  This isn�t a concern, however, because the bitcoin network runs on consensus, and accepts whichever blockchain is the longest. In practice, this means that whichever blockchain has the most computing power behind it is effectively guaranteed to win, as they�ll be able to calculate the solutions to the hash problems and find new blocks faster than their less powerful competitors.  This does mean that in theory, bitcoin is vulnerable to what�s known as a 51% attack � an attack in which if a single entity was able to gain control of at least 51% of the total hashing power being directed at bitcoin mining, it could outpace a legitimate blockchain and temporarily take control of the network.  This is an extraordinarily difficult feat to accomplish, however, as the more people there are mining bitcoin, the harder it is to take over the network. At the current worldwide mining rate of almost 5 billion gigahashes a second, it would be extraordinarily difficult for even the most powerful organizations in the world (e.g., large-scale governments) to mount a successful 51% attack. It would be enormously costly, and quite possibly more financially detrimental to the attacker than to the network.  Indeed, the only thing a 51% attacker could really accomplish is destroying collective faith in bitcoin. They couldn�t somehow steal and gain all the value of bitcoins for itself. The attacker wouldn�t be able to generate new bitcoins on demand arbitrarily, and would still have to mine for them. They also would have no control over taking bitcoins created in the past that didn�t belong to them. The only thing they could do, really, is repeatedly spend bitcoin they already owned again and again, but even this is limited in its value, because �honest� miner nodes would never accept these fraudulent payments.  Hence, no rationally self-interested bitcoin miner would ever try to mount a 51% attack, as in all likelihood, they would lose massive amounts of money doing so and gain almost nothing from the effort. The only reason someone would want to conduct a 51% attack is to attempt to destroy faith in bitcoin � large governments, for instance, who might one day feel that their fiat currencies that presently provide them great value to them are becoming threatened by bitcoin. However, the likelihood even of these enormous entities to successfully conduct a 51% attack is already becoming vanishingly small, as mining power increases.  Thus, bitcoin has perfectly utilized recent technological advances to create something heretofore impossible: an extremely safe, reliable, decentralized, and globally transactable digital and better version of gold, and possibly of all types of extant currency at large.  The advantages don�t stop there, however. Bitcoin is also �pseudonymous�, meaning that while all transactions ever conducted on the network are public and known by all as everything is recorded in the blockchain, unless someone knows who owns the bitcoins that are being used in these transactions, there is no way to trace those bitcoins and transactions back to a given person or entity.  This serves a dual purpose of both allowing extreme transparency when desired in making transactions, and also allowing a lot of anonymity when desired. If one wants to ensure that they have perfect undeniable proof of their transactions, all they have to do is prove they own certain bitcoins, and then any and all transactions conducted with those bitcoins are undeniably theirs and most certainly occurred.  If one wants, rather, to keep the movement of their money less overt, one simply needs to ensure that the bitcoins they own are never tied to their identities, and that their transactions on the network are obfuscated. This can be accomplished with a variety of methods, such as using a tumbler, which allows one to send bitcoins to an intermediary service that will mix these bitcoins with bitcoins from numerous other sources, and then send bitcoins forward to the intended destination from sources entirely unrelated to the sender�s original bitcoins.  To clarify this a bit more, bitcoins are stored at what are known as �addresses�. Think of this as an email address or a mailing address. These addresses allow for the storage, sending, and receiving of bitcoin. The blockchain ledger contains a complete record of the movement of bitcoins from one address to another.  A tumbler allows someone who say, wants to move bitcoins from address 10 to address 100, to instead move their bitcoins from address 10 to a totally random address, say 57. In some other transaction, the tumbler has accepted bitcoins from someone entirely unrelated at say, address 20, who wanted to send the coins ultimately to 200 and sent these instead to another completely random address 42. It then sends the coins stored at address 42 from sender 2 to the address sender 1 originally desired, 100, and sends the coins stored at address 57 from sender 1 to the address sender 2 desired, 200.  This is highly simplified, but effectively how a tumbler works, albeit at much larger scale, and with many more senders and receivers of all sorts of varying amounts.  This ability to transact more anonymously in a digital, global fashion than ever before has indeed opened the gateway to some of bitcoin�s more infamous use cases. Much illicit activity has been enabled by this pseudonymity of bitcoin, including the sale of drugs and other illegal goods online. A more recent development has also been ransomware, whereby malware can now cut straight to the chase and lock up your computer and demand straight up money in the form of bitcoin in exchange for the release of your computer�s data.  These developments have been enabled not only by bitcoin�s pseudonymity, but also the irrevocability of transactions. Unlike current forms of digital payment, such as credit cards and bank transfers, bitcoin transactions are irreversible and do not involve any middleman who can mediate between disputes.  This has its disadvantages, but also its advantages, and was indeed one of the primary benefits the creator of bitcoin (a pseudonymous as-of-yet unidentified figure himself, Satoshi Nakamoto) outlined in the bitcoin white paper. In his own words:  Commerce on the Internet has come to rely almost exclusively on financial institutions serving as trusted third parties to process electronic payments. While the system works well enough for most transactions, it still suffers from the inherent weaknesses of the trust based model. Completely non-reversible transactions are not really possible, since financial institutions cannot avoid mediating disputes.  The cost of mediation increases transaction costs, limiting the minimum practical transaction size and cutting off the possibility for small casual transactions, and there is a broader cost in the loss of ability to make non-reversible payments for nonreversible services. With the possibility of reversal, the need for trust spreads.  Merchants must be wary of their customers, hassling them for more information than they would otherwise need. A certain percentage of fraud is accepted as unavoidable. These costs and payment uncertainties can be avoided in person by using physical currency, but no mechanism exists to make payments over a communications channel without a trusted party.  What is needed is an electronic payment system based on cryptographic proof instead of trust, allowing any two willing parties to transact directly with each other without the need for a trusted third party. Transactions that are computationally impractical to reverse would protect sellers from fraud, and routine escrow mechanisms could easily be implemented to protect buyers.  As Satoshi notes, bitcoin�s irreversible, trustless nature removes the need for any middlemen to mediate and broker the process of payments from one person to another. Middlemen (e.g. banks and credit card networks) inherently introduce overhead costs and inefficiency into the system, which make transactions � and micropayments in particular � more costly than would otherwise be the case.  Fraud is also inherently eliminated, as any transaction propagated and confirmed by the bitcoin network by 6 or more blocks is generally accepted to be impossible to ever revoke.  Trustlessness in this sense is a huge component and advantage of bitcoin and cryptocurrency at large. Another ground-breaking innovation the blockchain introduces is the concept of a smart contract, or a contract that similarly requires no trust or middleman to mediate, but is rather contractually executed in a deterministic fashion through code run on the blockchain.  Traditionally, with a legal contract, two parties agree to certain terms with the understanding that if one party reneges, the other party can seek legal recourse with the governmental justice system. Lawsuits, however, can often be inordinately expensive, and in many cases the outcome is far from certain. A good or bad lawyer can make or break a case, and one is also at the mercy of a judge and/or jury and their subjective, possibly mercurial whims. Not the most efficient or foolproof system.  A contract written with and enforced by code, however, removes the need to trust a third party arbitrator (such as a court system), in much the same way that transactions enforced by bitcoin�s code remove the need to trust a third party financial institution. The code is written in such a way that clearly specifies the conditions of the contract, and will automatically enforce these conditions.  For instance, if two parties decide to make a bet on Donald Trump winning the election, historically, this could only be done by either word of honor or by some ad hoc legal contract. For a say, small $100 bet, it would be absolutely a non-starter to pursue legal action in the case that one of the parties decided to renege on the deal in the aftermath of the election. Normally, the reneged-upon party would simply be left in the dust without recourse.  With the advent of smart contracts made possible by the blockchain, however, this is (soon-to-be) a thing of the past. One can create a simple smart contract at effectively almost no cost that specifies in code that each party will send it $100 in bitcoin, and that upon the completion of the election process, it will either send all $200 to the party that bet on Donald Trump winning the election, or send the $200 to the party that bet on him losing the election. No ifs, ands, or buts. The code is clear, objective, and deterministic. Either the contract is fulfilled in one direction, or it is fulfilled in the other. No need to trust the other party in the bet at all, much less a third party to mediate.  Ethereum, as will be noted later (hopefully in another article because my god I never want to write again), takes this concept to the next level and runs with it.  One further benefit to bitcoin is that it is truly yours to own, and you can keep it yourself, without the need for a bank or any other intermediary, and use it just as easily as you might a credit card. This ensures that you won�t fall victim to a banking system collapse brought on by fractional reserve banking or irresponsible government and financial institution fiscal policies in general. It also ensures, however, that no one can take your money from you even on an individual basis, global financial apocalypse aside.  This, like systemic banking failures, is not something most people generally have to worry about 99% of the time. However, in the 1% of cases where this does become an issue, it becomes a very serious issue. Refugees and other victims of persecution and oppression are clear examples of this.  As a refugee, generally, if you hope to escape with your money, you have to carry it in physical form on you, either in gold or in paper currency. This is limiting for a few reasons: one, you can only take so much as you can carry or convert to physical form, and two, physical currencies are exceedingly simple to detect and confiscate.  Again, while this all seems incredibly far-fetched today for most people (but not all, as the present day European migrant crisis has made abundantly clear), it happens much more often than one might expect. A little remembered fact is that the United States itself once outlawed the possession of gold, back in 1933 with Executive Order 6102, and forced all its citizens to relinquish all gold to the United States at a fixed price of $20.67 per troy ounce.  Immediately thereafter, the US Treasury revalued all their gold at $35 per troy ounce for foreign transactions, and in the process reaped an enormous profit at the expense of all the citizens that were forced to give up their gold at fire sale prices.  It sounds incredible, but this is real life. The government threatened to fine anyone caught possessing gold in violation of this order $10,000 ($185,000 today) and throw them in jail for up to ten years. A famous case involved one Frederick Barber Campbell, who had on deposit at Chase Bank over 5,000 ounces of gold (worth over $6 million today), and attempted to withdraw the gold that he rightfully owned. Chase refused to allow him to do so, so he decided to sue Chase for depriving him of his assets.  In response to his lawsuit (this case demonstrates the value of basically everything about bitcoin, from the ability to store your own money to the ability to not rely on the legal system for recourse), Campbell was counterattacked and indicted by a federal prosecutor, and had to defend himself in court for not giving up his gold.  Ultimately, while Campbell didn�t end up going to jail, the government did decide to seize all his gold, and confiscated all $6 million worth of gold from him.  It took a full 40 years, or until 1974, before Gerald Ford signed a bill making it once again legal for private individuals and corporations to own gold within the United States.  This underscores the oft mercurial whims of governments, even well-regarded ones like that of the United States, that most citizens heretofore have been subject to without relief or alternative. Most of the time, things run well enough that we all get by without having to think about this fact too much. Sometimes, however, things do go really, really wrong.  Bitcoin fundamentally changes this equation. Unlike even gold, bitcoin is nigh impossible, when stored correctly, for anyone to confiscate without consent. The addresses at which bitcoin values are stored are protected by �private keys�, which can be thought of as a password or a key to a lockbox. Without this private key, it is generally impossible to steal the bitcoins held at the public address to which the private key corresponds. So long as you keep this private key secure, your bitcoins are secure.  With things like brain wallets possible, this means that even in the worst case scenario, you can literally store your bitcoins in your brain and nowhere else, and thereby easily prevent their confiscation. Just yet another fundamental innovation in the evolution of currency that bitcoin has made possible � its fully intangible nature is actually an asset.  The intangibility of bitcoin, however, does seem to hang some people up. It�s sometimes difficult to immediately conceive of how bitcoins could possibly hold value, as these people contend, when they are intrinsically worthless. They are nothing but a concept, backed up by some computer code. Gold is a physical, tangible object that you can hold in your hand. It has real uses in industry and as jewelry that lend it value. Even paper money can be used for kindling or toilet paper if the need necessitates.  Bitcoin, on the other hand, is fully intangible. It is just a concept backed by code, no more, no less. It can�t be used for anything functional besides being transferred in concept to other people as a store of value. How could something like this possibly hold value like other existing currencies?  It�s a good question, and one that underscores just how interesting the concept of money really is, and how rarely we actually think critically about it.  Sure, let�s say that you can�t compare bitcoin to gold and say it�s better because gold has tangible, real-world utility and bitcoin doesn�t.  What is the value of that real-world utility? Only about 12% of gold purchased every year is actually used for industrial and medical purposes. If this is truly where gold�s value is derived from, gold would be worth dramatically less than it actually is.  To the other point, gold�s coveted status in jewelry is merely a derivative property of its perceived value, which leads to its designation as a status symbol. Without that underlying perceived value, it would command far less value in jewelry. Consequently, the question still remains about the gap between the industrial and medical value of gold and the actual value of gold as determined by the market. Where does the value in that gap come from?  This is even more true of paper currency. Yes, you can utilize and reuse the paper for all the intrinsic value paper has. But what is that intrinsic value of paper? This is easy to answer, because we can just see how much the government pays to make paper money. $1 and $2 bills cost less than 5 cents to make on the low end of the spectrum, while $100 bills cost 12.3 cents on the high end.  Even the $1 bill, which seems to be the best deal if one is valuing the worth of one�s currency based on its intrinsic �tangible� value, has only ~5 cents worth of actual paper value behind it, or <5% of its actual denominated value. Where does the rest of that 95 cents of value come from?  It turns out these gaps in value between the worth of the �tangible� thing itself and the actual value of the currency as it stands on the market today is just as much conjured up out of thin air as a mere concept as bitcoin�s perceived value is.  This �intangible� worth that we ascribe to currency, which accounts for the vast majority of the value of all currencies, not just bitcoin, is ultimately what makes money work. Yuval Noah Harari captures this fact very well in Sapiens, where he lays out the case that the value of a given form of money is essentially an indication of trust in that form of money. It is our shared collective trust and belief in a currency that gives it value, not its intrinsic tangible utility or anything else.  Gold holds its value well because we trust that we will all collectively continue to trust it as a store of value forever, predominantly due to its scarcity and lack of centralized control. Fiat currencies hold their value well when they do because people trust that everyone else trusts the currency as well, and that it is deserving of trust. The moment that collective trust collapses, so too does the currency, no matter what its intrinsic �tangible� value.  This is why no fiat currency has ever stood the test of time over a long enough timescale, whereas gold has to date always stood the test of time and retained its value well. Collective trust for gold has never collapsed because of its inherent scarcity and immunity to the vicissitudes fiat currencies must endure at the hands of capricious centralized governing powers, whereas collective trust in every historical fiat currency has inevitably failed to date, and collective trust in many present-day fiat currencies continues to fail as we speak.  With this in mind, bitcoin can arguably be seen as the purest form of money, as its value is entirely predicated on trust in it, and nothing else. It can arguably also be seen as the most trustworthy of currencies, as it was bespoke made by intentional design to exhibit all the best elements of historically trustworthy currencies (e.g. gold), as well as to introduce for the first time a number of characteristics that make it even better than all previously extant currencies.  If people have trusted gold to date as a store of value because of its inherent scarcity and resistance to centralized control and price/supply manipulation, bitcoin does all that and more, and does it all better. Gold�s scarcity, as illustrated above, is anything but constant, and we�ve more than doubled our world�s supply of gold in just the last 50 years. Bitcoin, on the other hand, has a precisely and publicly known proliferation schedule, and will approach the limit of its supply in just a few more decades.  As a thought exercise, imagine a new fledgling nation called the United States came into formation and decided to create their own fiat currency today. At the same time, bitcoin is introduced as a currency.  Which would you trust? My personal bet would be absolutely, wholly, and unequivocally bitcoin. With the new US currency, I would be effectively required to trust that the US government would act without fail over the entire course of its indefinite existence to practice perfect fiscally responsible habits and not screw up its economy in any dramatic ways. I would also be aware that even under perfect circumstances, the currency would be fundamentally designed to inflate, and consequently my money would continue to lose value over time if I decided to hold and save it.  Furthermore, I would be forced to use an intermediary financial institution such as a bank to hold my money for me, and thereby expose myself to yet another layer of required trust and accompanying risk. I would also be aware that these institutions would almost certainly practice fractional reserve banking to the maximum extent they could get away with it, such that they would be extremely fragile to small perturbations and vulnerable to things like bank runs and runaway systemic banking collapses.  On the other hand, with bitcoin, I wouldn�t have to trust anyone at all. I would know for certain that my coins wouldn�t lose their value due to inflation as a consequence of their designed and indelible scarcity. I would also know that as I stored my coins myself, no one else, not even a bank, could actually go and spend 90% of my money, and fail to give it back to me in the event of a bank run. Furthermore, no one could forcibly confiscate my money under any circumstances, as I could always store it in such a way that it could never be retrieved except with my consent. No one would even necessarily be able to know how much money I held, unless I chose to make that information public.  Remember: just 13 years after its inception, the US currency had already suffered fatal runaway inflation and collapsed. Bitcoin, on the other hand, is worth more than ever just 9 years after its inception, and currently boasts a market cap of over $40 billion. Which would you trust?  The other common argument against bitcoin is that it is useless for any real world functions right now besides ransomware and illegal activities, and is therefore worthless because it has no good use cases.  This is a fundamentally flawed argument that can be lobbied against absolutely any new technology or invention, and fails to take into account the natural process of growth and gradual adoption over time. The exact same argument was used against the internet in its early days, and I find this article from Newsweek, published in 1995, particularly illuminating in this regard.  After two decades online, I�m perplexed. It�s not that I haven�t had a gas of a good time on the Internet. I�ve met great people and even caught a hacker or two. But today, I�m uneasy about this most trendy and oversold community. Visionaries see a future of telecommuting workers, interactive libraries and multimedia classrooms. They speak of electronic town meetings and virtual communities. Commerce and business will shift from offices and malls to networks and modems. And the freedom of digital networks will make government more democratic.  Baloney. Do our computer pundits lack all common sense? The truth in no online database will replace your daily newspaper, no CD-ROM can take the place of a competent teacher and no computer network will change the way government works.  What�s striking in this is that while everything he said at the time was true, and certainly none of those things were particularly possible back in 1995, it all came to pass eventually. Today, remote workers are a huge part of the global workforce. Online education is booming. Amazon is taking over all of commerce and is larger than any retail store in the world. Print newspapers and magazines are dying left and right, replaced by a proliferation of online news.  The same growth trajectory is how I see bitcoin, cryptocurrency, and blockchain technology at large playing out. If all goes well � and there�s no guarantee it might, everything indeed might fail and all our hopes and dreams might gang aft agley � there�s no reason at all that bitcoin can�t one day surpass even our wildest imaginations today, just like the internet did before it, and fundamentally rewrite the script for how we interact with money and the world as a whole.  Yes, today, it is far from this goal, but even now, we make progress in pushing forward the utility of bitcoin in every day pragmatic life. Already, it has proved indispensable to myself and hundreds of thousands of people around the world. I pay many of my employees today in bitcoin, even, because several of them live in Eastern Europe where they�re subject to draconian capital controls.  Were I to send them a wire (as I used to), their banks demand a mountain of documentation detailing every last dollar and hold their money for upwards of half a month before ultimately releasing it to them. Naturally, this is a pain in the ass and highly inefficient, time consuming, and resource intensive for all of us. Bitcoin easily sidesteps all of these issues.  Bitcoin is also dramatically cheaper to use than almost any other form of international money transfer today. Already, for this use case alone, it proves its worth over current dominant international money transfer solutions, such as Western Union. I can transfer money to anyone in the world, in any amount, and have them receive it without moving a finger in just a few minutes. For this privilege, I have to pay just a few cents, no matter how much I�m sending, instead of a huge proportional percentage, with hefty minimum fees and surcharges.  It�s also extremely convenient and valuable for a merchant to use, and we had great success implementing it for a trial run at my company Sprayable back in the day. In the past, we�ve suffered from rampant fraud after our site was targeted on a carding forum (a place where people buy and sell and use stolen credit cards). When we were paid in bitcoin, however, these concerns were completely eliminated, as fraud is an impossibility on the bitcoin network with enough confirmations.  This is only the beginning. You don�t expect a horse to become a world champion racer straight from the womb. It takes time, training, and a fair bit of luck. The same is true of bitcoin and blockchain technology. But just because a horse may not be a world champion just quite yet, it doesn�t mean you shouldn�t bet on that horse in the long run. If you see potential in that horse, and are willing to wait it out for the long run, go ahead, bet on that horse. One day, it might just take over the world, and if it does, you might just win big.  Part II: Investment Philosophy  Okay � now that you hopefully have a good grasp of what cryptocurrency is and why it�s interesting, we can move on to dipping your fingers in getting some.  We can all be honest � the reason the vast majority of you are reading this is probably because you�ve heard a lot about just how much money people have made investing in cryptocurrency. Many, if not all of you, are wondering how you, too, can get on the gravy train and start making millions.  This isn�t necessarily wrong, or inaccurate. This is the reason I first started paying attention to bitcoin. Countless people *have* made shocking amounts of money investing in cryptocurrency. I�ve personally made over $400,000 in less than two years. In fact, bitcoin has already proven to be the best investment in all of recorded history by a shocking margin for those who got in at its most early stages.  Here�s a story about a completely random Norwegian student who bought 5000 bitcoins for $27 back in 2009. Today, with a single bitcoin pushing past $2700, those 5000 bitcoins are worth over $13.5 million. That�s a gain of over 500,000X. No other investment in recorded history that I�ve been able to discover has ever come close to touching these sorts of gains.  Even the Dutch tulip bubble, which is classically regarded as one of the first instances of massive speculative market mania, saw increases only on the magnitude of 10�100X � not even remotely close to 100,000X+. And even the most successful of extremely risky angel investments in companies, such as Peter Thiel�s initial $500,000 seed investment in Facebook, see returns on the scale of 10,000X or so or less � Thiel�s $500,000 investment, had he held it all the way to the present day, would be worth $6.8 billion, or approximately a ~13,500X gain. More incredible than just about anything else, certainly, but still nowhere even near Bitcoin�s meteoric rise in price.  What�s also striking is that traditionally, these sorts of �angel or seed� investments in new technologies have been closed off to all but an incredibly well connected inner circle of elite high net-worth individuals and institutions. Peter Thiel, for instance, was only approached to become Facebook�s first outside investor because he was already incredibly well known within Silicon Valley for having founded and sold PayPal for over a billion dollars. In contrast, with bitcoin, a random student in Norway was able to invest just $27 and make millions.  That said, just as with everything, there�s survivorship bias here. What you don�t hear about are the profusion of people who lost their entire fortunes investing in cryptocurrency. While there are a few ways you can beat all the odds and come out vastly ahead in cryptocurrency, there are infinitely more ways you can lose everything you put into it and end up in a much worse place than where you started.  Here, I�ll try to cover the most common �mistakes� people have made. Do keep in mind that this is all entirely my own opinion. Please come to your own conclusions here.  The most common mistake people seem to make is investing solely based on the price alone and its short term historical trajectory, and nothing else. The second mistake is investing in assets that they don�t actually understand or believe in long term, are not planning to hold for at least 5 years, and will be tempted to sell if the price begins to fall in the short term. The third mistake is believing that they�ve already missed the boat on the most established and successful cryptocurrencies, like bitcoin and ethereum, and that consequently they should invest in much less established, much more speculative �altcoins� to achieve truly outsized gains, for no truly good reason besides the fact that the price/market cap for the altcoin is a lot lower than bitcoin�s, and seems like it has more room to grow. The fourth mistake is day trading, and trying to capitalize on short term market movements. I�ll address each of these in turn, and why I believe them to be mistakes.  On the first mistake � I made this mistake myself when I first got into cryptocurrency. I first heard about bitcoin from a friend who was raving that we should all get into it just around the time the price of a single bitcoin reached $100. He had gotten in at $30, and was extremely pleased with his gains.  At the time, it was relatively big news that bitcoin had reached $100. I remember thinking to myself that it was clearly too late to get in, and promptly forgot all about bitcoin.  The next time I heard about bitcoin was in the fall of 2013, when it began its last truly meteoric price rise from $100 all the way up to $1200. This time around, I distinctly remembered thinking I�d missed the boat back when the price was just $100, and kicked myself for being totally wrong. I resolved to not make the same mistake again, and tried to get in before I missed out again.  I ended up wiring several thousand dollars to an incredibly sketchy Russian exchange, BTC-E.com, to purchase my first few bitcoins at around $1000 apiece. Before I knew it, I was addicted to constantly checking the price, and spent a full 48 hours doing nothing at the height of the November 2013 bubble doing nothing but refreshing BTC-E.com and seeing how my investments were doing.  I ended up making another big mistake here too, and figured that bitcoin had already gone up way too much, and that my best bet was to invest in some smaller altcoins as well. I made this decision after seeing litecoin (LTC) skyrocket from $4 to $40 in just a few days. The buzz at the time was that litecoin would be to silver what bitcoin was to gold. The price seemed incredibly low compared to bitcoin, and this made a superficial sort of sense (meaning, no sense at all), so I decided to jump in. For good measure, I also decided to jump into a few of the other most popular altcoins of the time � peercoin (PPC) and namecoin (NMC).  The 2013 cryptocurrency bubble burst just a few days later, brought on by the collapse of Mt Gox, the largest bitcoin trading exchange at the time. It was revealed that Mt Gox had either been hacked or embezzled from, and no longer had any funds left to honor customer withdrawals. As a result, anyone who had decided to keep their bitcoins in Mt Gox at the time instead of withdrawing them to their own wallets ended up losing all their money. How much the price of bitcoin rises doesn�t mean anything if you lose all your bitcoins, unfortunately.  The price of bitcoin cratered about 80%, falling all the way to about $200, before stabilizing at that price for much of 2014 and 2015. Litecoin, on the other hand, fell from over $45 to about $1, and consequently lost over 97.5% of its value. PPC and NMC suffered so badly that I didn�t even bother to calculate how much I had lost, because it was basically everything.  This is when I first saw the light, and realized that investing in altcoins that I didn�t really believe in, and that didn�t really have any truly compelling reasons they would ever overtake bitcoin or deserve any level of market share, was an incredibly foolish move. It was certainly true that these altcoins did often gain on bitcoin and appreciated far more rapidly in many cases while the bubble held strong, but the moment it began to collapse, the altcoins were the first to go, and often fell all the way to zero.  As a general rule, what goes up can come down, and what goes up particularly quickly is privy to come down just as quickly. This is not to say that things will come down if they go up, but merely that they can, and certainly have before. This is particularly noteworthy today, with ethereum having seen some truly wild gains this year, all the way up from $7 back in December of last year to over $350 presently � a gain of 50X in just about half a year. Again, this isn�t to say ethereum will fall, but merely that it very well might, for any host of reasons, and it�s very important to keep this fact in mind and not overextend yourself with investments you perceive to be less volatile than they truly are. I�ll get back to this more later.  What I ended up learning was something the smartest people in the investment world had learned a long time ago. Benjamin Graham, the mentor of Warren Buffett, who became the richest man in the world by practicing the principle of value investing, has a pretty wonderful analogy that I think is worth repeating here. You should buy your stocks (or any investment, generally) like you buy your groceries � not like you buy your perfume.  What he means by that is that for some reason, people tend to buy stocks when they�re going up in price, and sell them when they�re going down. At face value, this makes no sense. We wouldn�t buy a watermelon when it was $10, and sell it when it was $2. With groceries, it makes intrinsic sense to us to buy watermelons at $2, not $10, but seemingly not so with our investments.  The short term price movements of a stock shouldn�t concern a long term value investor in the slightest, as a value investor doesn�t care about what the market has valued the price of a stock at, but rather only about the intrinsic value of the business behind the stock, and its future potential value. Only after coming to a conclusion about the actual value of a company and its future potential value, should an investor then look to what price the market has assigned a stock, in ascertaining whether or not a stock is a good purchase.  In the case of a watermelon, what we intuitively grasp is that there is some fundamental, intrinsic value to the watermelon, and a �fair� price for it. We have a general understanding of what this price should be, and are more than happy to buy watermelons when they are on discount relative to their fair price, and are reticent to do so when they are being sold at a premium to their fair price.  If we decide that a watermelon�s fair intrinsic value is $6, then we�d be happy to buy watermelons all day long at $2, and reticent to do so at $10.  With investments, it�s the same deal. If we decide that Company X is presently worth $100,000 dollars, and that it has strong growth potential in the future, and the market is presently valuing Company X at $50,000, that would probably be a good buy.  On the other hand, if we decide Company X is worth $100,000, and has ambiguous future potential, and the market is presently valuing it at $200,000, it might not be such a good buy.  In a third case, if we decide Company X is worth $100,000 today, and has extremely strong growth potential, and the market is valuing it at $100,000 today, it might still be a good buy to hold and capitalize on that future potential.  In all of these cases, however, a value investor first and foremost must decide, with rigorous analysis and thorough examination, what they believe the fair value of an investment to be, and what degree of future potential it has. Only from there do they then examine what value the market has assigned the investment, in order to ascertain whether or not the investment is a wise one likely to yield good returns. Under no circumstances should one ever buy into a stock without knowing much, or anything at all about the stock, save for the general market sentiment or hype surrounding it, and its short term price movements. Buying a stock merely because it has seen great gains in the past, without any understanding of why it saw those gains and what gains it might expect to see in the future based on fundamental analysis of the stock, is an inordinately risky and foundationally bereft strategy.  If you�re interested in learning more about value investing at large, I�d highly recommend The Intelligent Investor, by Benjamin Graham, who again was Warren Buffett�s personal mentor and a professor of economics at Columbia University. He pioneered a lot of the foundational concepts around value investing, and can give you much better and more nuanced advice than I ever could.  All of this said, while these principles can and should be kept in mind at large for just about any investment, cryptocurrencies are dramatically different from stocks, bonds, or any other sort of traditional investment vehicle. They�re also so early stage and so volatile that it�s a near-certainty that a value investor like Benjamin Graham wouldn�t even dream of labeling such opportunities as investments, rather than speculations (at best, they would be labeled growth investments, but I�m working with the Buffett philosophy that there is no difference between �value� and �growth� investing, and that good value investing appropriately takes into account growth).  Investments, under this distinction, would be clarified as things that could generally be safely assured not to suffer from dramatic, catastrophic losses in the absence of dramatic, catastrophic situations. Coca-Cola and Walmart might be considered investments. They�ve been around for well over a century and a half century respectively, are massive, mature companies with a healthy track record of stable, non-volatile growth, and show no general signs of turmoil that might portend a sudden collapse in value.  Speculations, on the other hand, are like the Wild West of opportunities. They�re extremely high risk, extremely volatile, and could on one hand multiply one�s principal manyfold, and on the other, dissipate it all into thin air. A seed �investment� in Facebook, for instance, could be considered a speculation. In the vast majority of cases, such an investment is likely to fail outright and lose all of the money invested. In a few instances, however, that investment just might succeed, and return tens, hundreds, or even thousands of times the principal invested.  It�s important to note that the mere fact that something is speculative does not necessarily mean it can�t be a good investment, or that it is merely akin to blind gambling, dependent solely on the luck of the draw. Poker might be a suitable analogy. Poker can be played well or poorly, and skill and calculation lends an incredible degree of advantage to a player�s odds of success. However, the game still fundamentally deals with an immense degree of unavoidable variation and unknowns, and even the best poker player is guaranteed to lose many of their games, even if they play each one �perfectly�. The goal, simply, is to win more than you lose, and with the right amount of skill, knowledge, and preparation, this is a possible feat in poker.  The same might be said of speculative investments such as those in cryptocurrency. You can and absolutely should do your part to learn as much as possible about this field, and come to your own personal conclusions on its current and future potential value. However, no matter how much research you do and how many calculations you make, there will always be a fundamental and inextricable degree of pure luck involved in determining the ultimate outcome of your speculation. Any number of future events could tip the scales for or against cryptocurrency, or more specifically, any one cryptocurrency, and a number of these will be �black swan� events that are fundamentally unpredictable in their nature and timing, but in aggregate whole, almost certain to occur.  Just because there is this element of luck, however, does not mean that you necessarily shouldn�t play the odds, if you so believe with very good reason that those odds are in your favor. What you do have to make sure of, however, is that you have such good reason to believe that those odds are in your favor, and that you don�t put up more than you can afford to lose, given the odds. The key takeaway and lesson to be learned, again, is to invest, both in speculations and in �safer� investments, based on firm knowledge of the underlying asset and intrinsic analysis, to the extent possible, and never merely based on price movements.  In the case of bitcoin, my personal belief is that there is enough to justify the possibility of long term gain based on fundamentals and first mover advantage. If everything goes right, I do see a future in which it�s possible that bitcoin achieves a market cap similar to that of gold�s, given that so far as I can see, it provides all the benefits gold does, and a host of incredibly valuable advantages on top of those existing benefits. I even see a future where it just might be possible that bitcoin goes even further, and becomes a dominant leading global currency. It�s also possible that bitcoin�s blockchain is used to power many future technological innovations, such as smart contracts and even DAOs, and thereby creates and imbues itself with even more value.  At the same time, I also see a million and one ways where bitcoin fails to reach the promised land. Bitcoin has already experienced numerous growing pains, and at the present moment, is suffering most acutely from a huge backlog of transactions that can�t be fit on the blockchain. This is because blocks are presently limited to 1 MB in size, and can consequently fit only a small fraction of all the transactions that are trying to be propagated over the network. This forces those who want to have their transactions go through to pay inordinately high transaction fees in order to prioritize their transaction over other transactions.  There are already a number of proposed solutions to this issue, such as the implementation of the Lightning Network, but in order to implement these solutions, the majority of bitcoin miners must agree to update their bitcoin software. Many bitcoin miners are reluctant to do so, in large part because high transaction fees are good for miners, at least on a short term basis, as it means they earn far more per each block mined. The implementation of the Lightning Network and other solutions threatens to take away this extra revenue stream. Hence, users of bitcoin and miners of bitcoin find themselves at odds with a very understandable conflict of interest. It�s unclear as of yet how this will be resolved, though it seems the community is pushing forward towards a resolution, and I�m of the personal belief that they�ll get there eventually.  Similar problems like this are virtually guaranteed to occur in the future as well, and it�s simply impossible to predict right now how the bitcoin community might respond to and handle those problems, and if they�ll be successful in doing so.  At the same time, it�s entirely unclear how governments will respond to bitcoin as it continues to grow, and if they�ll attempt to crack down in a very strong way and prohibit the use of bitcoin, or the creation of bitcoin related service companies, such as exchanges. If exchanges were banned from operating, for instance, it could very well make it very difficult for most people to transact between fiat currencies and bitcoin, and render the latter far less useful than it otherwise might be.  On the flip side, if the world suffers a global financial meltdown on the scale of the Great Depression or something similar again, and fiat currencies start to crater, it very well may be such that governments are forced to resort to accepting bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, if enough people simply flat out refuse to put their stock in fiat. This was exactly what the US government was forced to do just 13 years into their original experiment with Continental currency, when they agreed to promise to back all the currency they issued with hard gold and silver.  These are just a few of countless twists and turns and vicissitudes our much vaunted (and much derided) bitcoin will have to endure before its long journey comes to an end, either six feet under or as an indelible fixture in our global economy. There�s no telling which way it will go, and one must come to one�s own conclusion on how much faith and conviction one chooses to place in bitcoin.  That�s the case as I see it for bitcoin. In the case of most altcoins, however, I don�t see remotely enough to even begin to justify the possibility of long term gain in the first place. Even with speculations, or perhaps especially with speculations, it�s incredibly important to thoroughly analyze a given investment opportunity for at least the potential for long term gain and success, and assess the magnitude of that possible gain, and then to weigh that potential versus the likelihood of outright failure of the speculation. With most altcoins, their value over bitcoin or ethereum is far from clear, and generally superficial or minor at best.  Dogecoin is the most pure example of this. Dogecoin offers just about no fundamental innovations over bitcoin, and is in fact a self-deprecating cryptocurrency premised (initially, at least) entirely on poking fun at itself. The name itself is a reference to the doge meme, and offers little to no further justification for its existence.  Despite this fact, Dogecoin�s market cap is presently valued at over $300 million. Come to your own conclusions here.  Less immediately obvious examples include things like Litecoin. Litecoin, too, offers fundamentally no truly great innovations over bitcoin � in short, nothing that bitcoin itself couldn�t adopt over time. It uses a different hashing algorithm and just adopted Segregated Witness, the same update that bitcoin is debating adopting that would allow the implementation of layer two protocols such as the lightning network, but beyond this, doesn�t have much in the way of unique differentiation going for it. This said, Charlie Lee, the creator of Litecoin and previously the Director of Engineering at Coinbase, one of the most well respected and successful bitcoin exchanges, just announced his departure from Coinbase to focus solely on improving Litecoin. It remains to be seen what will come from this endeavor, as Charlie certainly is without question one of the most accomplished and formidable players in the cryptocurrency sphere, but largely litecoin appears to be a small hedge in the slight off chance that bitcoin doesn�t actually manage to resolve its scaling issues, and begins to catastrophically lose market adoption and faith and crumble into the ground. In a case like that, the notion is that litecoin would be able to quickly take over the ground lost by bitcoin, and become the dominant cryptocurrency.  There are a number of issues with this, however, and a lot of things would have to go right before this occurred. There are several cryptocurrencies, for instance, with ethereum being the most notable, that are already far larger than litecoin, and it would have to be demonstrated that there�s some reason something like ethereum couldn�t simply take the place of bitcoin, and that litecoin would have a better shot at doing so than the larger players that already exist in this space.  Litecoin would then have to deal with exactly the same issues bitcoin has faced at scale, and it�s not clear at all that litecoin would fare any better at resolving such conflicts if ever reaches the same scale as bitcoin presently has.  All of this said, it does seem extremely likely to me that there will inevitably be some true innovation in this space, and that some cryptocurrencies will be able to carve out niches of varying degrees of value. One might even prove to ultimately demonstrate so many more advantages as to overtake bitcoin one day � ethereum, for instance, is teetering remarkably close to doing just that, at least in terms of market cap, if not quite yet other markers such as developer activity and transaction volume. The true feat here will be discerning those few new technologies with true fundamental potential and innovative advantage (and an incredible execution strategy) behind them, from the vast swaths of similar looking yet ultimately worthless contenders almost certainly doomed to eventual failure.  Expected value is a useful concept frequently employed in poker that also serves to provide utility here. In short, expected value is a way to decide when an outcome is not certain, but a set of outcomes are probabilistically determinable, if a given action is going to be net positive or net negative, and to what degree.  The simplest example is flipping a coin. This will yield heads 50% of the time, and tails 50% of the time. Expected value of betting on the coin yielding heads, hence, is 0. This is because in any one given flip, the coin has exactly a 50% chance of coming up heads. Hence, if you bet $100 on the coin coming up heads an infinite number of times, your expected gain, or value, from such an action, is to be $0.  Conversely, if you bet at even odds that a six sided dice roll would come up 3 or higher, your expected value would be positive, as you would be correct 2/3 times. Hence, if you repeated this bet an infinite number of times, you would be guaranteed to be earning more money than you lost.  Similarly, if you were able to bet at 1:2 odds (meaning if you bet $100 and win, you get $200) that a coin would yield heads, this would also be very +EV (positive expected value). The coin would still yield heads half the time, but that half of the time, you would earn $200, and the other half of the time, you would only lose $100. Hence, repeating this bet an infinite number of times would allow you to dramatically earn more money than you lost yet again.  There are far too many variables and unknowns to take into consideration with most speculative bets, and cryptocurrency in particular, to be able to hope for anything so nice and clean as an exact mathematical probability of how + or -EV a given bet on a given cryptocurrency might turn out, just as there are far too many unknowns to calculate the precise fundamental present and future potential value of a cryptocurrency for the purpose of value investing analysis, but regardless, holding both principles at large as a general guiding strategy in determining one�s actions here and elsewhere is a good bet.  Personally, for myself, a quick back of the napkin calculation that I can do to estimate the possible future value of bitcoin is to see what the market has valued all of the gold in the world at, and use this as a rough guiding principle for seeing how much appetite the world currently has for something that can hedge against other currencies and holds similar characteristics to gold as a store of value. I can see that the total value of all the gold in the world is over 8 trillion dollars, and consequently, if bitcoin were to reach that same total valuation, each bitcoin, assuming 21 million eventual bitcoins, would be worth approximately $400,000. Dividing this by bitcoin�s current value, I can see that there�s still room for approximately 150X gains. This means that if I truly believe this is a possible outcome for bitcoin, then as long as I believe this outcome has more than a 0.66 percent chance of happening, or 1/150 chances of success, it would be an +EV bet to make.  That said, it�s extremely important to keep in mind that one doesn�t get infinite opportunities to keep playing this bet out over and over again. There is only one bitcoin in the world, and we only have one opportunity to play out this exact bet. Given this fact, it�s important to realize that if this were somehow to actually be a perfectly EV neutral bet, with a possibility of a 150X upside and a 0.66% chance of realizing that upside, it would still mean that we have a 99.33% chance of losing all our money that we place on this bet. It would be extremely foolish, therefore, to invest all our money into such a wildly speculative investment, even if it is technically EV neutral or even slightly EV positive. What might make sense, is to set aside a responsibly proportionate amount of money specifically earmarked for such wildly speculative investments as a part of a holistic investment portfolio, that one is fully willing and able to lose without significant impact to one�s well-being or quality of life, and to invest that amount of money in a +EV bet like this.  Returning to the question of calculating potential investment upside here, there are countless other ways to make projections on the future potential value of bitcoin, and I encourage you to try to make some depending on your personal beliefs regarding the level of success bitcoin might have, and the ultimate utility it might provide to the world. For instance, if you see bitcoin primarily as a way to simplify making international transactions and cut out inefficiencies there, you might look to see what the overall market size is for a solution that might solve that problem and capture that market. Western Union, as one example, is a company with a market cap of $9 billion. Consequently, it might be reasonable to expect that bitcoin�s true ultimate value would be something roughly in that order of magnitude, if this were to be bitcoin�s one true long term use case.  If you see bitcoin as most useful for its blockchain, you might calculate hence the value you think can be created through applications, contracts, and other technological innovations run on the blockchain, and use that to guide your estimation of bitcoin�s value.  If you think bitcoin will be used to primarily enable black market transactions, same deal. And so on.  I hope that this elucidation provides some insight into why I personally see it as suspect to invest in something based on price alone, and why I urge extreme caution particularly if one is exploring whether or not to invest in an altcoin, especially if one is at least partially motivated to do so because of the feeling that the ship has already sailed for bitcoin, and that there might be better potential for outsized gains with a smaller altcoin. Again, this certainly may be true, and often is true even for altcoins destined for eventual failure in the short term while a bubble/bull market continues, but risks are amplified just as much as the opportunity itself when it comes to altcoins, and oftentimes moreso in a bubble than otherwise.  It�s easy to be swept away in the fervor of a frenetic market, and the fear of missing out can be overwhelming especially when you see altcoins rising by wild amounts overnight, but my personal guiding philosophy is to always try to keep in mind fundamentals to the maximum extent possible, to never invest in anything I don�t actually understand or see long term value in, and to only invest in things I intend to hold very long term (for at least 5 years), especially in such a volatile market.  Speaking to that last point now (the �second� mistake I mentioned at the beginning of this part) I�m of the personal opinion that it is incredibly important to not only invest solely in things that I truly believe have the real potential to succeed in a big way long term, but to actually commit and hold to that investment, once I make it, no matter what happens with the price short term. If some fundamental fact underlying my investment changes, I can certainly re-evaluate it, but if the price drops 90% or even 95% in the short term for no particular reason except a collapse of a local maximum in price speculation (e.g., a bubble popping), I must never be tempted to sell and try to �time� the market in any way. Instead, I have to hold that investment with firm conviction in what I believe the eventual price based on fundamentals is worth, regardless of how the market values it in the present moment.  This is critically important precisely for incredibly volatile speculative investments such as cryptocurrency, and plays into the fourth mistake I mentioned above, day trading, as well. More than possibly any other market I�ve seen, short term price movements for cryptocurrencies are oftentimes absolutely mystifying and nothing short of mind boggling. Highly anticipated events, such as halvings in bitcoin�s reward per block mined, come and go without any real perturbation in price. Other times, things rise when reason seems to suggest they should fall, and fall when they seem to have every reason to rise. For instance, bitcoin�s price collapsed to $200 after the bubble popped in 2013, and stayed stagnant at those levels, despite massive development in bitcoin infrastructure and significant growth in the adoption and usage of bitcoin over that same period of time.  More recently, the approval or rejection of a bitcoin ETF was widely touted as being the contributing factor to a bitcoin bull run from under $1000 to over $1200. It was speculated that if the ETF were to be rejected, that naturally the price would fall to where it was before the bull run began. Indeed, the moment the ETF was announced as rejected, the price did momentarily fall to almost $1000. However, it just as quickly recovered, and began an inexorable climb all the way up to over $2700, where it stands to this day.  Consequently, with the short term price movements of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies being incredibly volatile and oftentimes nothing short of inexplicable, I highly caution anyone against making decisions such as selling their bitcoins on the way down in anticipation of a market crash, so as to either avoid the crash or to buy their coins back at a cheaper price at the bottom of the crash.  This goes hand in hand with mistake number four I mentioned above: day trading. This is absolutely number one the reason I see people who have gotten into bitcoin and cryptocurrency lose their money. If you at almost any point in the history of bitcoin (earlier than say, this month of June), merely bought bitcoin and held it to the present day, you would have made money. However, countless people have actually lost money in bitcoin, and this is because they ended up trading their bitcoin somewhere along the way.  I would venture to say that most people have far more confidence in their ability to predict short term market movements than is actually the case. I�ve seen plenty of instances of people who have thought that they could capitalize on short term volatility on the way up, and essentially �buy the dips and sell the tips�, and in every single instance I can recall, this strategy eventually fails, and often in a big way. At face value, this seems to make sense. If you think you can time when the dips will occur and when they will end, and similarly when the peaks will occur and when those will end, you can definitely make more profit along the way by selling high and buying low.  However, as I�ve mentioned before, this is far more difficult, if not impossible, to do with cryptocurrency, more than even normal investment vehicles like stocks. I�ve seen people who think that bitcoin has hit a peak and must necessarily stop going up sell, intending to wait until bitcoin falls again to buy in again and make maybe a 20% extra profit, miss out entirely because bitcoin kept going up and never came back down. There are numerous stories of those who bought into bitcoin at $1 or less, but sold well before it ever reached even $10, much less $2500.    Real friends getting real screwed with real money  With something as speculative as cryptocurrency in the first place, it makes no sense to invest in this space to begin with if your only goal is to make 20% profit. It almost certainly isn�t worth the risk at that level of gain. Hence, risking losing out on the long term upside of 10X+ that you�ve calculated and come to the conclusion does exist for a gain of less than 1X or .5X in most cases makes little to no sense at all. It only makes sense if it�s essentially a guaranteed gain with no risk, and that, again, is almost certainly not the case.  Indeed, some market movements are fundamentally unpredictable in their short term timing. Two very vivid examples of this were the collapse of Mt Gox for bitcoin, and the hacking of the DAO for ethereum. Both of these events absolutely cratered the price of bitcoin and ethereum respectively, and both of them were fundamentally unpredictable in their exact timing. These are examples of the black swan events I mentioned that are certain to continue playing a large role in short term price developments for bitcoin and all other cryptocurrencies at large, that make it doubly dangerous for those who day trade.  I�ve also seen plenty of people who intend to hold long term, but lose faith when they see their investment crater 30%, 50%, or even 70%. At this point, they lose faith, and decide to sell their investment to at least recoup some of their initial capital, and not lose everything outright. Thus, they end up buying high and selling low, and then having double regret when bitcoin eventually ended up rebounding even higher than the �high� they bought at.  This illustrates even more vividly why it�s incredibly dangerous to invest in anything you don�t actually believe in, and aren�t willing to hold, long term. If you aren�t going to hold something long term, then generally you must believe that while the price will rise in the short term, it will not continue to rise in the long term. If you hold this belief, it generally means that there�s some reason that you believe what you are investing in won�t hold true value long term, but that there is enough speculative mania in the short term to make the price go up anyway. The thinking goes that if this is going to be true, you might as well profit from this speculative mania and buy in now, wait for a little bit for the price to rise, and then sell it for short term profit.  The problem with this is that just about everyone else investing in these things is thinking the same thing, and everyone involved is effectively playing the greater fool theory, expecting that they will be smarter than everyone else and be able to time the market better than everyone else, and get out before everyone else does, and before the price eventually collapses. By mere inviolable fact, most people who engage in this form of speculation are guaranteed to lose in a big way. Over enough iterations, the eventual likelihood of loss generally grows to become one, in my opinion, as one must continue to time a market correctly time and time again for this to work. While it may seem like the market will continue being bullish for you to get in and get out before things go south, this is true of every moment in time right up until things go south all at once. Inevitably, at some point, the gravy train will have to derail and explode in a rolling ball of fire.  I know for a fact that I�m certainly not remotely smart or knowledgeable enough to pull off this kind of short term investment that aims to profit from market sentiment alone, especially not in the turbulent, mercurial waters of cryptocurrency, and that�s all I can say about this here. On top of this, the existence of black swan events that can crater an entire market unpredictably short term introduces a variable that inherently is just about impossible to predict, and makes short term bets like this even more dangerous.  The most dangerous game of all, then, in my opinion, is day trading in altcoins that one doesn�t believe in long term. This is basically combining every �mistake� I mention above: trading in something because of short term price movements, not holding it long term, day trading, and speculating in highly risky small cap altcoins. If you manage to survive doing this over any long period of time (5 years+, let�s say) and end up net profitable (particularly if you end up more profitable than just buying and holding over that same period of time), please do let me know, as I�d be extremely curious to hear just how you pulled it off.  Going back to my personal story, ultimately the crash from $1200 to $200 for bitcoin was the best thing that could have ever possibly happened to me. At the time, of course, it certainly didn�t feel that way. It felt like I had made an absolutely stupid, foolish decision, and had lost all my money. In fact, I did make a stupid, foolish decision, but not for the reason I thought at the time. I didn�t make a stupid, foolish decision because the price had cratered to $200. I made a stupid, foolish decision in deciding to invest in bitcoin and altcoins without actually having done my research and without really knowing anything about them.  Had I actually done my research and believed that it was a fair bet to make that one day bitcoins would be worth far more than even the height of the local maximum bubble at the time, it absolutely could have been the right decision to buy in then, even if it crashed later temporarily to $200. What wasn�t right was buying in simply because the price was going up and I had a fear of missing out.  The crash proved to be the best thing that could have happened, however, because it gave me time to actually do my research and learn about bitcoin, and have real reasons for believing in it long term, at a point in time where the price was unusually deflated. As a consequence, I was able to buy more bitcoin at the very bottom of the market, around $230 or so, when I became truly convinced of bitcoin�s long term potential. I was also lucky enough to decide not to sell the bitcoins I had originally purchased for $1000 or so, and ultimately saw even those return 250%+ in profit.  It was at this time, incidentally, that Coinbase, became worried about stagnant growth of their user base, and decided to offer a truly astounding proposition. They offered to pay anyone who referred a new customer to Coinbase $75 if the new customer purchased just $100 in bitcoin. Coinbase took a 1% transaction fee at the time, meaning that for every $100 in bitcoin a person purchased, Coinbase charged $1. In short, Coinbase would pay out $75 for every $1 a new customer paid them.  It didn�t take a genius to see a clear arbitrage opportunity here, and I wrote up a quick blog post detailing this opportunity and fired out a single Facebook post telling my friends about it. From that post and just a few hours of work, I ended up earning almost 17 bitcoins entirely for free � worth over $45,000 today. I had plans to scale this strategy en masse, but singlehandedly ended up killing the program almost as soon as it started, when Coinbase finally came to its senses and realized just how much money it was hemorrhaging here with no hope for eventual recoupment (at the time, the lifetime value of the average customer was only something like $25 to Coinbase � a far cry from the $75 they were offering).  Digression aside, that sums up most of the thoughts I have about the primary things to be cautious about when it comes to bitcoin investment. There are a few more practical matters to be extremely cautious about (namely, how you store your cryptocurrency), but I�ll address those in the next part, which will be an actual how-to guide showing actually actionable steps for those interested in getting into bitcoin investment.  The final point to make, then, are a few thoughts on how to correctly invest in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. I have no truly great pieces of wisdom to offer here, but do have a few ideas that primarily aid in being psychologically being resilient to the short term vicissitudes of cryptocurrency investment.  Once you�ve decided that you truly believe in a cryptocurrency long term, and are willing to commit to it for the long term and hold it no matter what the short term price movements might be, the next step is to decide how much to invest, and when to invest. One might be hesitant, with not bad reason, to invest at an all time high, even if one believes that that all time high will one day be exceeded.  The mere fact that the future potential is still huge doesn�t necessarily preclude the fact that cryptocurrency may be in a short term bubble, and that prices might crater any day by 30%, 50%, 80%, or even more.  Generally, the strategy suggested to average out such short term volatility for something that one is investing in long term is to practice dollar cost averaging. This preaches that one should set an exact time at regular time intervals to buy an exact amount in fiat currency of the investment one is looking to purchase � e.g., $1,000 worth of bitcoin on the 1st of every week, or every month. This means that over time, you�ll be able to take advantage of bitcoin�s general trajectory upwards, but balance out the relative short term volatile price movements both high and low, such that you experience a more linear growth trajectory over time of your principal.  I think that this is a great strategy, and personally practice it with a few modifications. While I�ll never sell at any price essentially (unlike other investments, bitcoin and cryptocurrencies are unique in that they are currencies, and consequently if they succeed, you won�t have to sell them to gain value from them. You can just use them directly, just as you might US dollars or any other form of currency. In the manner that I use the word sell here however, I mean that I likely won�t sell at any price under $100,000, as that�s where I personally see the moonshot value of bitcoin going towards, in the slight chance that it does succeed), no matter how high the price rises in the short term, if and when the price becomes particularly low as a result of a cratering market, I will look to buy more than I normally would, to double down on my investment here � all the while keeping in mind never to invest more than I�m perfectly willing to lose entirely.  Psychologically, if it�s helpful, I think it may be fine to sell off some small portion of your upside if you do realize upside over time, in order to recoup your initially invested principal. I don�t think that this is necessarily the most optimal actual move to make, but do think it likely makes a huge difference psychologically, such that it makes it far easier for you to hold your remaining investment with sangfroid in the case that it ends up cratering sometime in the future.  As for investing an initial lump sum to begin getting exposure in this space, my personal strategy would be to do a semi-timed dollar cost average, if one is particularly concerned that they might be investing just before a local minimum market crash, but also particularly concerned that the price may keep rapidly appreciating ad infinitum, and would like to get in before that happens. That is, I�d decide the total lump sum I�d be willing to set aside to invest here, say, $10,000, and invest 33% or 50% of it immediately. Then, if the market did crash, I�d be psychologically very happy, and be super excited to invest another 33% or 50%. On the flip side, if the market continued to rise indefinitely and never fell again, I�d also be happy that at least I was able to get exposure to the market and didn�t miss out entirely. A 33�33�33 split would allow me to invest 3 times when I felt the market was at a particularly good time for investment, and a 50�50 split twice. Just random arbitrary examples of divisions I might do here, depending on how exactly wary I feel about the market at the present moment in time.  That about sums up my thoughts on cryptocurrency investment at large. There are some nuances, but I figure 8000+ words worth of a brain dump is a good enough place to start. If you�re still here, please feel free to read on to Part III if your constitution allows for further word consumption.  Part III: How to Buy and Store Your Cryptocurrency  The shortest section by far. If you made it this far, you deserve to just be able to buy your crypto and be done with it all. I�ll try to make that as easy as possible. There are still quite a few bases to cover, however.  Note: The following bit about exchanges to use holds true for those in the United States. For those based elsewhere, you�ll need to do your own research on the best exchanges to use in your country. The rest of this post should hold the same for everyone in the world, however.  The easiest way to invest is to sign up at Coinbase.com. If you sign up with a referral code, you get $10 when you purchase $100 in bitcoin or ether. I�ve linked my mom�s referral code here if anyone is interested. Straight to her retirement fund! (In the interest of having zero monetary gain from my fiduciary advice, however, just email me if you use this link and buy over $100 of bitcoin, and I�ll send you the whole $10 my mom receives on her end as a referrer � so you get $20 for investing $100. Not bad! ?SORRY NEVER MIND I�VE BEEN OVERWHELMED WITH THESE MESSAGES AND CAN�T KEEP MANUALLY DOING THIS, but you�re still welcome to use the code and get a free $10 and give my mom a free $10 too!)  However, this is not the cheapest way to invest. That�s GDAX.com (no referral bonus with this, though). Thankfully, GDAX.com is the same company as Coinbase, and utilizes the same login. Once you make your Coinbase account, you can just login with it to GDAX.com.  At GDAX.com, which is Coinbase�s exchange, you�re able to get trades in for either 0% as a market maker (meaning you limit buy or sell and set your own price and �make� the market), or 0.25% as a market taker (meaning you just buy or sell at whatever price the market is currently at with a market buy).  You can trade immediately as much as you want by sending a wire (only applicable for US customers) to your account following their deposit instructions. There�s a $10 fee for this that GDAX charges, on top of whatever your bank charges to send wire transactions. This is the fastest method to deposit any amount of money you want and trade immediately with no limits, but not the cheapest.  You can alternatively conduct ACH withdrawals from your bank as well by going to the Coinbase accounts page, clicking on your �USD Wallet�, and clicking the Deposit button in the top right hand corner. These are completely free, but take anywhere from four business days to a week to complete.  You can even use a credit card to buy straight from Coinbase.com, but fees here are very hefty. Use as a last resort.  Keep in mind that while you can put however much money you want into GDAX at any point in time, you are generally limited to withdrawing $10,000 per 24 hour period. Thus, if you are buying a large amount of say, Ethereum to send to a token sale address, keep in mind that if you want to send over $10,000, you�ll need to purchase that amount and withdraw it well in advance of the token sale.  For instance, if you wanted to send $100,000 of ethereum somewhere, you�d need to buy all that ethereum and withdraw over the course of 10 days (assuming you withdrew perfectly each day every 24 hours � realistically more like 11�14 days) back to Coinbase or your personal ethereum wallet before you could then send that ethereum on to somewhere else all at one time, like you would need to do in a token sale.  On GDAX, you can buy bitcoin, ethereum, or litecoin.  From there, if you�d like to buy any alternative currencies, you can use your bitcoin or ethereum on Shapeshift.io without any account to instantly transfer your bitcoin or ethereum to any other cryptocurrency under the sun, essentially.  To buy/sell on Coinbase or GDAX, you need no wallet, as Coinbase/GDAX will keep your coins for you. You�ll want to enable Google Authenticator for two factor authentication and keep your passwords and your phone incredibly secure, however, as if someone hacks your account, all your money is gone for good with no recourse. This happens a lot. Use a super strong password that you have not used elsewhere and that no one knows and that you won�t forget.  Ideally, you�ll keep the coins yourself on your own hardware device, which is ultra secure. I recommend Trezor.io (as of this writing, they�ve just run out of stock, but are only backordered a few days if you�re willing to pay a premium) for this purpose. Ledger Nano S is also good and cheaper to boot, but I personally haven�t used it and it�s very backordered in sales. I can recommend Trezor 100% wholeheartedly, however.  Trezor will keep your coins safe because the device itself is immune to hacking by design, and never exposes your private keys (the passwords to your accounts, essentially), even if your computer is infected by malware and is logging all your typing/passwords, or is specifically scanning for private keys, or is engaging in any other form of sneaky bad behavior.  It does this by signing all transactions on the device itself using your private key, and only transmitting the signature to your computer, and never your private key. As a general rule, this is very good, because a good rule of thumb is to never expose your private keys to the internet, under the assumption that the internet is inherently insecure, and if you ever have your private keys interact in any direct way with a computer that has been connected to the internet, you should consider the addresses those private keys correspond to to be compromised and vulnerable to being hacked.  A Trezor also allows you to set multiple passwords that open secret vaults to different wallets on your device, such that even if in some crazy scenario someone just kidnaps you and threatens to beat you with a wrench until you give them your coins (not too crazy actually � I�ve been abducted before and had to ransom myself for thousands of dollars in Africa), you can just give them a second password to another wallet that holds say $500 in cryptocurrency instead of $10 million, and there�s no way for them to know that that�s not all the money you had on your Trezor.  If someone steals your Trezor, they won�t be able to find your coins either, as they�re protected by a PIN that only you know (plus a password if you want to use that feature I mentioned above). You can also recover the coins yourself with the recovery seed the Trezor will give you the first time you use it, which you should store in a super safe location like a safe deposit box somewhere. If you don�t use utilize the password feature, however, keep in mind that anyone who discovers this recovery seed instantly has access to all your coins, and all your other forms of security are for naught. If you enable the password feature, however, they will need your password as well as the recovery seed in able to access your cryptocurrency, which makes it significantly more secure.  A Trezor will give you your own personal wallets for bitcoin, ethereum, dash, zcash, and litecoin, as well as any ERC20 token built on top of ethereum.  Another benefit of holding coins yourself, in a hardware wallet or elsewhere, is that you know that you 100% own all of your money. Exchanges are just like banks, in the sense that you trust them to hold your money for you. If they end up losing that money to hackers or stealing it themselves, you�re out of luck. This isn�t just a scary bedtime story � countless cryptocurrency exchanges have been embezzled or hacked (an enormous percentage, actually), and hundreds of millions of dollars have been lost.  Moreover, in the event of a hard fork, whereby two blockchains are created, and consequently, two sets of coins that you technically should own, only some exchanges will actually give you access to both sets of coins. Most notably, Coinbase has explicitly stated that they will only give you access to the dominant blockchain that emerges from a hard fork, no matter how much value the market assigns the non-dominant chain. They may or may not give you access to the other coins in the future, but there is no guarantee either way. In any event, with any exchange you are fundamentally agreeing to trust them to give you access to both sets of your coins, even if they say they will. If you own your coins yourself in your own wallet, however, you need to trust no one. You will automatically own both sets of coins by default in the event of any fork.  This, too, is not merely a theoretical matter. Ethereum did indeed hard fork after the DAO hack, and split off into ETH (the current dominant blockchain for ethereum) and ETC (the �classic�, or original blockchain for ethereum). As of this time, ETC is worth over $20 a coin � more, in fact, than all of ethereum was worth before the hack. Had I kept my ethereum on Coinbase or another exchange like it at the time of the hard fork, I personally would have lost 5 figures in ETC (at present values) merely because the exchanges wouldn�t give me access to these coins that I rightfully owned.  Finally, my personal preference is to avoid keeping all my eggs in one basket. Despite the fact that a hardware wallet like Trezor is technically one of the most secure options for keeping your coins safe with a fair amount of redundancy in recovery options, the fact remains that one day I might somehow lose access to my coins held within Trezor. I might suffer a concussion, for instance, that causes me to forget the password or the PIN required to access the Trezor, or perhaps I lose my Trezor and am unable to locate or decipher my recovery seed.  Because of this, I actually personally keep my cryptocurrency distributed in several reasonably safe baskets. For instance, despite Coinbase being an exchange that fundamentally requires some trust, they are more trustworthy than almost any other exchange on a technical level (their customer service, however, leaves something to be desired), and it is virtually impossible for their coins to be hacked to any significant degree, and all those at risk of being hacked are fully insured. As a consequence, I leave some of my coins with them, merely because in many ways, I trust their technical security measures more than I trust my own. Before GBTC started trading at such an absurd premium, I also kept some of my funds with them, both in part to diversify across multiple platforms to reduce the risk of losing all my coins with one bad black swan event, and also because it was the only immediately easy way to put some of my retirement funds into bitcoin, short of creating a self directed IRA.  Okay � so that�s about it for investing in the dominant cryptocurrencies available today. If you want to invest in other more speculative altcoins, you�ll have to create your own wallets for them, and investigate the best and most secure solution for doing so yourself. This should generally be a good exercise in any case to determine if you meet the bare minimum requirements for responsible investment in a given altcoin.    ',\n",
       " 'Discodery created the first all-in-one solution that helps all kinds of businesses in their digital transformation. The Discodery digital solution is an intelligent, assisted and automated tool that allows deploying, without any technical knowledge, a personalized mobile native application (iOS and Android), a custom website and a complete management software.  With this solution, sales, bookings, online payments, coupons codes distribution, instant chat, customer file generation, digital loyalty card creation, task management, employees planning, social media publishing, push notifications, inventory management, SEO optimization� and many other features and just a few clicks away from any business owner.  The solution is distributed as a Software as a Service (SaaS) and is sold as a subscription from Discodery�s website. Discodery has its own sales team, but mainly relies on independent partners (called Discodery Partners) which are remunerated on a per-sale commission basis.  Today, Discodery would like to take advantage of the technological advances offered by the blockchain and cryptocurrency concepts to improve its digital solution, strengthen its security and make life even easier for its customers.  This publication aims at presenting the concept of the Discoin, its implementation details and its present and future use cases.    Discoin official logo  Disclaimer  The main objective of this publication is to present the Discodery digital solution and the related Discoin project. Under no circumstance it should be considered as an investment advice.  If you have any question regarding the regulations impact on our project, feel free to contact us at discoin@discodery.com.  A unique selling proposition�  Discodery has been founded in late 2017 by three tech lovers, in Hong Kong SAR. Our business is worldwide, and Discodery is registered as a Limited Company in Hong Kong SAR. We also have offices in Paris (hosting our IT team) and in Barcelona (hosting our sales and marketing team).  Since the beginning of the project, our core work was to develop the Discodery solution, to test it and to find new customers, then to collect their feedback and to improve it continuously.  Our product is an all-in-one, fully-serviced solution that allows any small business owner to get its own website, mobile applications and management software in less than 72h and for a small monthly fee.  But our solution is more than just a website or a mobile application. Our goal is to provide our customers with a complete 360� solution to optimize and develop their business. The solution comes with unique management software, which is the control tower of our clients� digital identity and activity. It provides over 70 key features for them to grow their business online and offline as well as improving their work processes through automation and data.  The Discodery digital solution is a unique selling proposition on the market:  * It is affordable, meaning that at our price point, we have the ability to reach a much broader audience, which would not be interested otherwise.  * It is all-in-one, meaning that our customers do not have to subscribe to multiple solutions to benefit from the same level of service. We therefore eliminate the multiplicity of subscription and paid services for our customers as much as possible.  * It is fully serviced, as opposed to the do-it-yourself model. It means that our customers do not need any kind of technical knowledge to get started and the learning curve is very easy to overcome.  � for a wide range of industries  Our large set of features makes it a solution suited for all small business owners:  * Restaurants, bars, caf?s, bakeries;  * Beauty salons;  * Hairdressers and barbers;  * Massage parlors;  * Supermarkets and grocery stores;  * Liquor stores;  * Doctors, pharmacists and therapists;  * Veterinarians and pets groomers;  * Retails stores;  * Services providers and consultants;  * Etc.  Discodery�s market and current problems  Currently, Discodery operates in Hong Kong, France, Spain, French-speaking Africa, Mexico and UAE. By end-2019, Discodery is targeting 1000 customers worldwide and should be selling its solution in Central and South America, whole Africa, Australia and Asia by mid-2020.  Regarding the Discodery concept as a whole, digital payments are legitimately at the heart of the solution. Four money exchange channels are today used on a daily basis:  End customers need to collect money from their own customers as a compensation for their online sales, whether it is from their mobile application or from their website;  They also have the opportunity to create a digital loyalty program to reward their customers (in the form of discounts or products);  In the meantime, they need to pay to Discodery their recurring subscription;  And on its side, Discodery needs to reward the Discodery Partners for their sales.  All these exchanges of money are now possible on the Discodery solution, but are complicated, mainly because of the lack of technical solution in developing countries. We and our customers are also facing difficulties to send and receive money because of high currency conversion fees. Our vision about Discoin  First of all, when writing a white paper, a fundamental question needs to be asked: why we, at Discodery, do we think we need our own digital coin?  * Because we and our customers have a real business problem to solve when it comes to online payments and recurring payments in some markets;  * Because we love doing thing ourselves and are very passionate about the technology behind the blockchain concept as a whole;  * Because we love understanding what we are doing at a technical level;  * Because we want to build our own community that will decide the future technological improvements of our blockchain (and digital coin of course);  * Because we want to introduce new security concepts;  * ecause it is a unique opportunity for an initial coin offering, to finance the development of the Discodery project and the growth of our company;  * Because it facilitates the distribution of our first digital coins in the world.  The second fundamental question is: what are we going to do with our digital coin?  Our vision is to give access to the Discoin ecosystem to every business owner and every e-commerce platform developer. We defined a clear road map to achieve this goal (see �The Discoin roadmap).  Here were the few use cases anticipated at the time of writing this white paper:  * Get access to the Discodery ecosystem (more information about it can be found at https://discodery.com) by instantly paying in Discoins your periodical subscription or by turning on an automatic debit from your wallet.  * Purchase items to enhance your digital environment (domain names, e-mails addresses, custom templates, etc.).  * Get rewarded by sharing about Discodery and the Discoin on your social networks (from your digital environment control panel, the Gravity Board).  * Get rewarded by referring other people to join the Discoin adventure and subscribe to the Discodery ecosystem.  * And really soon, receive customers payments in Discoins from your website or mobile application.  Of course, this list is not exhaustive and will necessarily be completed over time with other use cases.  The Discoin technology  The Discoin is derived from the CryptoNote project, an open-source technology and concepts for the cryptocurrencies of the future.  Untraceable payments  Discoin payments are untraceable thanks to a completely anonymous payment schema implementing a ring signature technology.  This ring signature technology is a more sophisticated scheme of transaction verification that implies several different public keys. In comparison, traditional transaction verification involves only the public key of the signer (the one who initiate the transaction).  In the ring signature algorithm, groups of individuals with their own key pair are established for each transaction. A member of a group can sign a transaction with his own secret key, but the public keys of all the others members of his group are required to validate the transaction. This ring signature algorithm is a one-way process and cannot be reversed. That way, it is technically impossible to determine who the initial signer was among all the individuals of the group.  Unlinkable transactions  Receivers have multiple unique one-time addresses derived from their single public key which makes it impossible to cross-link payments.  With this principle, the CryptoNote algorithm solved the fact that everyone was able to check all the incoming transactions (and thus the resulting balance) of a given public address.  Thanks to a change in the Diffie-Hellman exchange protocol, the sender now uses the receiver�s public address and his own random data to compute a unique one-time key for the payment. The sender can produce only the public part of the key, whereas only the receiver can compute the private part.  The receiver is the only one who can release the funds after the transaction is committed. He only needs to perform a single-formula check involving his private key on each transaction to establish if it belongs to him. No third party can perform this check and discover the link between the one-time key generated by the sender and the receiver�s unique public address.  Double-spending proof  In the CrytpoNote implementation of the ring signature algorithm, a linkability feature has been added to restrict a signer to create more than one ring signature using the same private key, which would indicate a double-spending attempt.  To support linkability, a special marker called a key image has been added to every signature. The key image is the value of a cryptographic one-way function of the secret key. One-wayness means that given only the key image it is impossible to recover the private key. On the other hand, it is computationally impossible to find a collision (two different private keys, which have the same image). Using any formula, except for the specified one, will result in an unverifiable signature. All things considered, the key image is unavoidable, unambiguous and yet an anonymous marker of the private key.  All users keep the list of the used key images (compared with the history of all valid transactions it requires an insignificant amount of storage) and immediately reject any new ring signature with a duplicate key image. It will not identify the misbehaving user, but it does prevent any double-spending attempts, caused by malicious intentions or software errors.  Blockchain analysis resistance  The unique one-time addresses and the ring signature make the whole blockchain resistant to analysis.  Since every ring signature produces ambiguity, there are billions of possible graphs linking addresses with transactions. Moreover, every next transaction increases the entropy of the whole blockchain and creates additional obstacles for an analyst.  Egalitarian proof of work  The proof of work mechanism is actually a voting system. Users vote for the right order of the transactions, for enabling new features in the protocol and for the honest money supply distribution. Therefore, it is important that during the voting process all participants have equal voting rights. CryptoNote brings the equality with an egalitarian proof-of-work pricing function, which is perfectly suitable for ordinary PCs.  Adaptive limits  A decentralized payment system must not depend on a single person�s decisions, even if this person is a core developer. Hard constants and magic numbers in the code deter the system�s evolution and therefore should be eliminated (or at least be cut down to the minimum). Every crucial limit (like max block size or min fee amount) should be re-calculated based on the system�s previous state. Therefore, it always changes adaptively and independently, allowing the network to develop on its own.  CryptoNote has the following parameters which adjust automatically for each new block:  * Difficulty. The general idea of the algorithm is to sum all the work that nodes performed during the last 720 blocks and divide it by the time they have spent to accomplish it. The measure of the work is the corresponding difficulty value for each of the blocks. The time is calculated as follows: sort all the 720 timestamps and cut off 20% of the outliers. The range of the rest 600 values is the time which was spent about 80% of the corresponding blocks.  * Max block size. Let MN be the median value of the last N blocks sizes. Then the �hard-limit� for the size of accepting blocks is 2*MN. It averts blockchain bloating but still allows the limit to slowly grow with the time if necessary. Transaction size does not need to be explicitly limited. It is bounded by the size of the block.  Wallets  As exposed in our road map (see �The Discoin roadmap), the Discoin web wallet is the first released. Shortly after, GUI desktop and smartphone wallets will be released to facilitate the decentralization.  The command line wallet is of course available on our GitHub at https://github.com/discodery/discoin.git.  Exchanges  As exposed in our road map (see �The Discoin roadmap), an integrated exchange platform will be released by the end of 2019 to allow the trading of Discoins (first in EUR). In the meantime, we will work very hard to bring Discoin to several popular public exchanges.  Deep integration  The Discoin is going to be deeply integrated into the Discodery ecosystem, allowing to subscribe to one of the best digital solution with automatic recursive payments and to collect payments from end-customers. Later, the same level of functionality will be featured in the Discoin public payment gateway API.  Mining  Mining is available for everyone who wants to share his computing power. To join the Discoin miners, simply download and compile the Discoin binaries from our GitHub at https:// github.com/discodery/discoin.git and follow the README instructions.  A Discoin mining pool is available at stratum+tcp://discoin-mining-pool.discodery.com: 3333. Algorithm to use is cryptonote.  Everyone is welcomed to join and grow the Discoin miners community.  Payments are made automatically to the Discoin address given to the pool when the miner balance reaches 1000 Discoins.  Rewards and sharing  Mining is of course an easy way to obtain some Discoin as a reward for calculating power, but it is not the only way. Because the Discoin is deeply integrated with the Discodery digital solution, anyone can be rewarded in Discoins by sharing about Discodery or the Discoin and by bringing new customers to the platform. The Discoin initial distribution  From the beginning, it was planned to give the Discoin an important but limited supply.  A total of 2,000,000,000 Discoin will be emitted. A relative fast emission curve has also voluntarily been chosen. The objective was to emit 50% of all the Discoins after one year (from May 2018 to May 2019) and reward more prominently the first contributors (miners) of the project after its official launch (June 2019).  It allowed the Discodery team to pre-mine around 1,000,000,000 coins during one year of thought about the project and development. These coins will be dedicated to the Airdrop and ICO phases of the project and will help rewards several contributors to the project that weren�t always paid (in FIAT money) until then.  The Discoin ICO  How and why?  In order to help us grow the Discoin project, the ICO perspective has been considered.  The main goal of the ICO will be to support the launch of the Discoin as a cryptocurrency asset and help Discodery grow around the Discoin by integrating it in its ecosystem and by opening public APIs. The funds are planned to be used this way:  * 40% for the growth of the IT and development team;  * 30% for marketing and advertisement;  * 15% for legal implications around the project;  * 15% for the remuneration of the founding team.  Last but not least, the minimum investment amount has been fixed to �10 and two investment options will be offered from the official Discoin dashboard:  * By credit card, handled by the integration of the Stripe payment platform.  * With a Bitcoin deposit, handled by a random wallet generation for each transaction.  * The ICO has started in June 2019.  Phases and caps  The ICO takes place in two steps:  * A pre-sale, in which each Discoin bought will be rewarded by one additional free Discoin. This phase has a maximum cap of �250,000. When this cap will be reached, the ICO will automatically enter the next step.  * A main-sale, in which each two Discoins bought will be rewarded by on free Discoin. This phase has a soft cap of �2,000,000 and a hard cap of �8,000,000.  After the ICO, the Discoin will be introduced on the market at �0.025 per Discoin.  Rules  The following ICO rules have been established:  * The participation in the ICO is not limited and everyone can choose to participate more than once, in each phase.  * The coins distribution, including bonus, will occur at the end of each ICO phase. Please create at least one Discoin wallet before. You will be contacted by e-mail before the end of the corresponding phase if you invested and did not create a wallet.  * If the ICO does not come to an end, the sums will be reimbursed up to 80% to handle our processing fees.  Additionally, because the regulations are pretty strict, we will ask every participant in the ICO to fulfill the following conditions:  * Complete KYC before investing. Valid first name, last name, e-mail, phone, personal address and ID card scan are required. The profile validation will be done manually for each investor.  * Due to national regulations, USA, Canada, Iran, Iraq, Syria and North Korea will not be part of the Discoin project and heir residents will not be allowed to participate in the Discoin ICO.  The Discoin Airdrop  During six months after the official launch of the project (June 2019 to late November 2019), several airdrop bonus programs will take place from the official Discoin dashboard (available at https://discoinapp.discodery.com).  During these airdrops, each participant that completes successfully his profile will be rewarded with 400 Discoins. A successfully completed profile consists of:  * A registration with a valid e-mail address;  * A filled up profile (first and last names, country, Twitter and Discord username);  * A valid Discoin address.  A referral program has also been implemented, allowing every participant to share the Discoin airdrop program. Each validated referred profile will give an additional reward of 100 Discoins to the referrer.  Finally, a bonus section will reward every participant a random Discoin amount between 0,25 and 1. The participation is limited to one per day per member.  The accumulated coins will be transferred all the way through the end of the airdrop, once the registrations have been validated. It could take up to one month to limit the risk of fraud. Of course, the Discoin airdrop is limited to one participation per person. Anyone trying to mess with the system will see his account suspended and all his participation in the airdrop cancelled.  The Discoin founding team  The team behind the creation of the Discoin is composed of the five founders of Discodery. Below is a quick presentation of each one of them.  We sincerely hope that our team will grow as the Discoin project will grow. This is why anyone is welcomed to join the Discoin adventure!

Lorenzo MENEGHINI  Cofounder, creative director  Lorenzo is an entrepreneur specialized in digital and local businesses. He is the owner of a bar / nightclub (club-banana-cafe.com) and a print shop (copiesproma.com) generating 1,5M� turnover each. He is also one of the three cofounders of Discodery, bringing all his experience and ideas for innovation to the digital world. Today, Lorenzo leads the sales and the creative department for Discodery. He works actively on bringing the best user experience and user interfaces for the Discoin on all the digital supports (web/desktop/smartphone).  Mathieu MEYER  Cofounder, lead developer  Mathieu comes out of French school 42. He soon developed a great interest for low level programming languages, especially C and C++, for blockchain(s) and cryptocurrencies in general. He is part of the Discodery adventure from the beginning. His main role was to contribute to the development of the back-end solution (especially in Python and PHP) and to lead the development of the Android application (in Kotlin). On the Discoin project, Mathieu more particularly works on the development of the coin itself.  The Discoin roadmap  The Discoin ecosystem will be rolled-out step-by-step, taking care of delivering great products and features with a great continuous integration. That�s why it has been decided of a clear road map. Of course, the team will make sure to not forget to be agile if needed.  Here is the Discoin roadmap from the project beginning in May 2018 to the middle of 2020:  * May 2018: Development started  * June 2018: Public mining opened  * June 2019: Website and dashboard opened  * June 2019: ICO and airdrop launched  * August 2019: Mining pool launched  * October 2019: Integration in the Discodery ecosystem  * December 2019: Built-in exchange opening  * January 2020: GUI desktop and smartphone wallets release  * January 2020: Integration in public exchanges  * April 2020: Payment gateway in Discodery digital solution  * July 2020: Payment gateway public API release    ',\n",
       " 'In the last few days, many have asked about my investment strategy and portfolio mix after writing 95Percent�s: Blockchain Technology.  After much deliberation, in this post, I�ve decided to share my holdings with you. Perhaps more importantly, I�ve decided to also share my underlying philosophy. As a reminder, I know nothing. None of this should be construed as investment advice, and you should do your own research before making any investments. I would be financially okay if I lost all of my invested money: you should make sure you could survive a total loss before investing any funds.  But enough of that, how should you approach investing in cryptocurrencies? First, I advocate creating your own investment tenets. Tenets are also a crucial aspect of the product management process. I recommend creating tenets before diving into any business, project or problem.  Why do we write tenets?  * Tenets are used to make hard decisions  * Each tenet expresses the conflict arising from two (or more) competing philosophies  * Each tenet ultimately demonstrates preference for one philosophy over others  Most people have their own philosophies and preferences, but they don�t write them down. Writing them out is crucial because it crystalizes your thinking. Tenets are helpful when times are good and indispensable when things get tough. You should debate your tenets heavily with family, friends, and yourself. Below I share five of my cryptocurrency investment tenets:  Jason�s Cryptocurrency Tenets [January 2018]  1) I will prioritize platform investments (think Ethereum) over application investments (think Dash). Strong infrastructure scales and changes the world. Successful applications are hard to predict and are not stable over time. Platforms better withstand changing customer needs.  2) I will choose cryptocurrencies with user adoption and strong focus on user adoption over cryptocurrencies with the latest tech or prettiest whitepapers.  3) I will take the super-long term view. I will prioritize cryptocurrency that have the potential to be trillion dollar businesses and will stay away from currencies with more barriers to widespread adoption. If a cryptocurrency is unlikely to ever be used en masse, I won�t buy it. I investment in fundamentals not merely public opinion.  4) I will greatly value signals in the market, especially signals from entities with inside information and large investment positions � potentially over even my own analysis.  5) I value cryptocurrencies that demonstrate the ability to change direction, pivot quickly and make decisions over cryptocurrencies that emphasize status quo, tradition, and moving wisely but slowly. I recognize this is partly a function of team structure and leadership.  After painstakingly working through my tenets, I�ve researched many of the cryptocoins available today. Based on my personal investment philosophy and this research, I�ve made several investments over the last month. Here�s my positions as of January 11th 2018:  Jason�s Cryptocurrency Portfolio* as of January 11th 2018:  * Ethereum: 50%  * Stellar: 20%  * Neo: 20%  * Request Network: 10%  *I�ve rounded these numbers to make them prettier.  Ethereum: 50%  As we wrote in Blockchain Technology: �Blockchain technology creates information networks. The fundamental rule of networks is that when a new person joins any network, the network becomes exponentially more valuable. As a corollary, each time another person joins a widely-used network, it becomes exponentially harder for competing networks to offer similar value to people. You use Facebook because all of your friends are on the platform. You are less likely to use a new social network because few of your friends would be on it. As a result, networks tend to produce winner-takes-all markets. Facebook, WeChat and a few other businesses, for example, dominate the social networking space. We expect a similar winner-take-all outcome for blockchain technology. So far, founders have created many hundreds of digital coins. They will create thousands more over the next few years. We expect a handful of these digital coins to successfully walk out onto the global stage, while the vast majority of these coins will ultimately become valueless.�  Amazon is a platform. Facebook is a platform. Platforms dominate the internet. As we�ve seen from Ethereum�s creation of the Initial Coin Offering (ICO) platform, platform coins will dominate the blockchain coin as well. We�ll see many cryptocoins repositioning themselves as platform coins, especially starting in the second half of 2018 and into 2019 when many smaller, more niche coins start to flame out. Based on my research, Ethereum is currently best positioned to win the platform war. Pure and simple. I may change my view in the next few months or quarters but for now Ethereum gets the majority of my money.  Stellar: 20%  Stellar is a platform that wants to make it really easy for companies to ICO (versus using Ethereum). Stellar is ultra-focused on this use case, but that�s okay, because this use case is massive.  Again, per Blockchain Technology, �[blockchain] technology can also make physical-world assets more liquid (easier to sell and buy) by making them more reducible. In other words, the blockchain better facilitates ownership of assets across multiple people� while mega-companies (e.g., Amazon, AirBnB) have successfully built their own digital marketplaces in the past, blockchain provides the available-to-all, trust-building, low-cost financial infrastructure via smart contracts, secure transactions, and an authoritative ledger to [almost anyone]�Unlike crowd-funding sites like Kickstarter, where early backers receive nothing but a product or service, ICOs let entities actually own part of meaningful ideas.�  The tokenization of assets via blockchain is going to change the world. So far, this use case is the only one Ethereum has proved it can solve and I find it possible that Stellar eats some of Ethereum�s pie: I am watching Stellar carefully. Stellar focuses on usability (think: MVP) instead of extensibility (think: useless features). The founder started Mt. GOX and built the initial framework for Ripple. Stellar is backed by Stripe and has support from top advisors in tech.  Neo: 20%  Over the last decade, China has made it clear that they want to build their own solutions to world problems. I expect this trend to continue into the blockchain world, and expect at least a duopoly platform paradigm (at least one major smart contract platform for the West, and at least one smart contract platform for the East).  Request Network: 10%  Request Network is a platform specifically focused on the payments space (built on top of Ethereum). While the sized of the tokenization of assets space (e.g. ICO) is almost incalculable, the payments space remains enormous. Request Network is a big team bet. As a product leader, I value team organization a lot. I�ve studied the core developers of many of the top blockchain coins, and find that most projects are being run relatively poorly compared to more traditional software development projects today (partly a function of decentralization of blockchain teams). Many teams don�t have updated visions or project plans and as a result miss deadlines and seem to be prioritizing things no one wants. Request Network strikes me as agile, able to pivot quickly, and ruthlessly focused on user growth and customer experience. (I love the bi-weekly updates.). I also immensely value their time in YCombinator, the top startup incubator in the world.  Like the pre-blockchain startup world, real-life customer feedback is everything. I want a team desperate to get their coin to market. From there, they can interact with real customers and then make technical changes that are likely to lead to meaningful improvements for real customers.  Mainstream cryptocoins I am NOT invested in:  Bitcoin  In my opinion, a huge milestone for blockchain technology will be to move away from the Bitcoin Hegemony. Right now, the cryptocurrency market as whole is psychologically entwined with Bitcoin. When Bitcoin plummets, the market plummets, although we�ve seen signs of change in the last few weeks. In 2018, I predict that Ethereum (or another platform) will surpass Bitcoin. The cryptocurrency market will finally detangle itself from Bitcoin.  I don�t find pro-Bitcoin arguments particularly strong. Initially, Bitcoin initially saw a lot of success helping entities perform discreet transactions (think: Silk Road). Currently, though, Bitcoin isn�t particularly helpful in the payments space (slow, expensive, and unfocused): the digital currency is unlikely to scale to widespread user adoption for payments. Bitcoin also can�t help with ICOs: it is not a platform. Perhaps most concerning, from a development perspective Bitcoin moves slowly, has divided leadership, and doesn�t practice user-driven development (at least compared to other digital coins). Proponents cite these characteristics as advantages and argue that Bitcoin is a store of value.  We flesh out the digital coin role as a store of value in Blockchain Technology: �Blockchain technology also has potential to provide a new independent store of value. Today, the classic independent store of value, gold, is partly valuable because humans have decided to value it independently of nation states (e.g., Canada) or nation alliances (e.g., the European Union) unlike other mainstream currencies (e.g., the United States dollar is closely tied to the success of the United States of America). Gold is generally inversely correlated with the US dollar: in other words, gold acts as a hedge against the current global financial system. Because gold is difficult to store � heavy, relatively insecure � digital blockchain-currencies represent an attractive alternative. If digital currencies become more stable over time (currently, they are extremely volatile), they may one day augment or supplement assets such as gold.�  The problem is that no one uses Bitcoin as a stable store of value today. Additionally, Bitcoin is relatively uncorrelated with the US dollar, so it doesn�t act as a particularly useful hedge. Ultimately, I think digital coins will be strong store of values, but this is far, far down the road. At that point, I find that other cryptocoins are just as likely or more likely to act as global store of values compared to Bitcoin.  I further argued that the bigger and more immediate store of value opportunity is �helping entities buy into the global financial system in the first place. In developing countries, for example, many entities are eager to shift local, unstable currencies to stable currencies such as the US dollar to better protect their wealth. Like the US dollar today, the blockchain-backed currencies that facilitate world transactions tomorrow will also naturally act as a store of value. Entities will invest in these currencies as they do the US dollar today. As a result, the same blockchain-based currencies that gain mainstream adoption for payments are also likely to gain mainstream adoption as stores of value.� We will be forever indebted to Bitcoin but 2018 will mark Ethereum passing Bitcoin, the marketing falling, and then ultimately rebounding stronger than before. The age of the Blockchain Platform is beginning.  Privacy-centric cryptocoin  While, private, fully-anonymous transactions are a large blockchain use case, coins emphasizing privacy will struggle to gain mass adoption in the long-term. I expect privacy-centric coins to bear the brunt of initial government scrutiny and regulation. I choose to make my investments on the more public side of the blockchain movement. That said, Monero would be my current pick in the privacy-centric digital coin space.  Ripple  As we wrote in Blockchain Technology: �in the short-term, partial blockchain solutions [like Ripple] will become common. Already, financial institutions are creating their own private blockchain networks and producing digital coin. Participating institutions act as nodes in the blockchain, and have visibility into all transaction on the shared digital ledger.�  I like Ripple, and particularly the focus on getting customers. Like many others, however, I am concerned about the difference between the highly-valuable Ripple Payment Protocol and XRP as an investment vehicle. I also see in-house blockchain development from large institutions as meaningful competition.  Thanks  Hopefully my perspective is helpful. If I helped you crystallize your own thinking, I�d very much appreciate a small donation to my Ethereum wallet.  * Ethereum wallet: 0x81ff5029a05ce15c3b6d6e27c7d89a7c30ecaf32  Or just clap a lot =)  To trade, I buy Ethereum in CoinBase and then move these coins into Binance.  Coinbase: https://www.coinbase.com/join/5a39ac52c9e83802d5f70a27  Binance: https://www.binance.com/?ref=18572991  Again, this is not investment advice. I re-adjust my portfolio constantly based on new information and could have a completely different set of investments tomorrow. One must be careful not to be affected by sunk cost or fear of missing out biases � and strive to act as objectively as possible. Good luck.    ',\n",
       " 'NEO is a platform with a purpose. Can it compete with Ethereum? Or better yet, does it even need to?    Why Read This Article?  NEO and Ethereum � which pill will you take? Sorry, couldn�t help myself. We care about this debate because we�re investors. From a developer�s perspective, functionality is the most important. There is no brand loyalty in blockchain yet. So if a platform can do something better than its competitors, it will win over developers. So which one does it better?  This article is long because I have chewed through all the information I could find about NEO and Ethereum and digested it for you. There are lots of articles summarizing the �differences� between Ethereum and NEO, but they do the debate little justice. They skim over things, don�t explore them well, explore only one aspect, or aren�t holistic in their analysis and don�t explain why the differences even matter and what their relevance to the real world is. I was frustrated by the lack of a comprehensive article. This article is my response.  I will admit that I explored NEO more in-depth than Ethereum. This is because so much information is widely available for Ethereum. With NEO, there is much less. As such, I focus on explaining NEO and then comparing that explanation to Ethereum�s capability.  So bear with me, grab yourself an espresso and lock yourself in that room you �do work in.� This will be well worth your time. I also won�t blame you if you just read the TLDR � Too Lazy, Didn�t Read � under the articles.  Let�s begin  If Ethereum is Goliath, NEO is David. If Ethereum is Brad Pitt, NEO is Brad Pitt�s cousin, Zach Pitt�younger, better dressed, and more talented � but right now relegated to serving cocktails to Brad and his friends while he acts on the side. Ethereum did it first. It was revolutionary and exciting and took the crypto world by storm. Web 3.0. Today almost every ICO is built on Ethereum�s ERC20 token platform and Vitalik Buterin is one of our time�s greatest minds. Yet if we�ve learned anything from the fact that Alibaba is closing in on Amazon�s market cap and WeChat dominates China�s social media scene, it�s that China plays by their own rules. The Land of the Red Dragon uses their own technology, their own networks, and cares little for what the U.S. is doing. The question is, can NEO compete with Ethereum, and does it even need to?  Ultimately, NEO and Ethereum are aiming for similar roles in the crypto community. Both want to be platforms for the new internet: for DApps (Decentralized Applications), ICOs (Initial Coin Offerings), and smart contracts.  Overview of Ethereum and Neo  While both NEO and Ethereum have generalized blockchains that provide a toolbox for would be developers, their objectives differ. I would summarize each platform�s objectives as such:    Ethereum�s goal is to create a platform for the development of DApps in order to create a �more globally accessible, more free, and more trustworthy Internet:� an internet 3.0.    NEO is a blockchain project �that utilizes blockchain technology and digital identity to digitize assets, to automate the management of digital assets using smart contracts, and to realize a �smart economy� with a distributed network.�  That�s a mouthful. Let�s breakdown these objectives to fully understand the projects. It�s important to understand that both platforms share many of the same capabilities, but the distinction in their branded objectives is very important.  Ethereum: Ethereum�s goal is to be the platform for DApps and they are largely accomplishing this. They own the DApp market right now. Their roadmap is all about giving users and developers more control and more options in developing their applications.  NEO: NEO is working towards developing a product for the future. It not only rebranded from Antshares to NEO in June of 2017, but they refocused their marketing as well � with enormous success. Neo�s objective, while ultimately utilizing many of the same technologies as Ethereum, is to be the platform for a new smart economy.  In short: Ethereum is developing in response to new demands. NEO is developing their platform in anticipation of future demands.  What is a Smart Economy?  The biggest difference between NEO and Ethereum is NEO�s focus on a smart economy. If we want to fully understand NEO, we need to understand why this distinction is important.  A smart economy will feature digitized physical assets. All of these newly digitized assets will have proof of ownership in the blockchain. These assets can be sold, traded, and leveraged through smart contracts. Their ownership can be protected and validated through the decentralized model of the blockchain. We�ve already seen iterations of this: from proposed supply chain overhaul to DAOs (decentralized autonomous organizations � essentially decentralized companies without a leader). I offered some real world examples of this economy in this article. Now while Ethereum will likely support many of the same capabilities that NEO has, the distinction between Ethereum and NEO�s objectives is what we care about.    The distinction is important because a smart economy will still be under a government and under governmental regulation. I don�t trust the government as much as your next libertarian; I�ve read 1984 too many times. But the fact remains that governments aren�t going anywhere. Thus, for a platform to service this �smart economy,� that platform needs to put specific thought and intention into how it will accommodate governmental regulation. So while Ethereum might offer the similar blockchain capabilities, the fact that NEO is developing FOR THIS PURPOSE is crucial.  TLDR: A smart economy is in our future. To accommodate the needs of this smart economy, the platform will need to be specifically designed for this new economy.  What is NEO doing to prepare itself for the smart economy?  NEO places particular emphasis on staying regulatory compliant.  To do this, they need:    Governments don�t love these guys  Digital Identity  Anonymity is great. I think privacy should be at the forefront of today�s technological developments and discussions. But if companies and governments are operating on the blockchain, digitizing their assets, and issuing smart contracts, all under the watchful eye of the government, they can�t have anonymity. For a platform to be regulatory compliant, digital identity � a verifiable identity in digital form � is a necessary evil.  Today, digital identity is based on a system called the PKI (Public Key Infrastructure) X.509 standard. This probably means about as much as it does to you as it does to me. It just means that there is an international agreed upon standard for what constitutes a digital identity. NEO�s plan is to issue digital identities in accordance to this standard and then secure them using the blockchain. Bookkeepers (read about them later) will have digital identities and real names. Because of this, judicial action can be taken against them if ever need be. This is imperative when registering financial assets on the network and staying regulatory compliant.  There could also be businesses and projects that will only transact with people who have a digital identity, for regulatory reasons. NEO enables that possibility.  NEO is already working in a strategic partnership with THEKEY � a project being developed on NEO�s platform that will assist with providing digital identification.  What about Ethereum: Ethereum requires other DApps to develop digital identities which can then be secured on the Ethereum blockchain. This isn�t so unlike how it will work with NEO � however NEO has made it clear, through its plan to incorporate digital identity with its bookkeeper nodes, that integration of digital identity is of central importance to the NEO ecosystem.  TLDR: Governments don�t like anonymity. Industries don�t like pissing off the government. If NEO wants industrial adoption, it needs to have digital identities.  Digital Assets    A future digital asset?  If you want a smart economy based on smart contracts, you need to be able to leverage and exchange assets beyond currency. We need to be able to digitize assets like house, property, and car ownership; gold, diamonds, and other precious elements; computers, clothes, and food; even those baseball cards your mom keeps begging you to throw away. Smart contracts become so much more powerful when we have the ability to digitize all of these assets.  What about Ethereum: Very similar to the digital identity blurb. Ethereum absolutely can secure digital assets, but they won�t necessarily be regulatory compliant. NEO is ensuring that issued digital asset certificates will be compliant.  TDLR: Just read it  NEO�s complex network  The economy is complex; it has so many interconnected pieces. NEO�s platform is complex, with partnerships galore. Fully researching and understanding this is difficult. But I did it, so you don�t have to! Refer back to this visual to have a solid picture of how this network interacts.    Even though this looks like the deranged drawings of a conspiracist, it will make sense as you reference it while learning about NEO�s network    OnChain  NEO�s founders Da HongFei and Erik Zhang founded a company called OnChain. Understanding OnChain is critical to understanding NEO. They�re not the same company, but their interests align and they have a partnership together. OnChain�s system, known as DNA (Decentralized Network Architecture) aims to work with Chinese businesses and government. NEO acts as the foundation of DNA. If OnChain can integrate with Chinese businesses and government, that will greatly spur adoption of NEO.  Ultimately, DNA develops public and private blockchains for businesses. These blockchains then link up to NEO to join the decentralized economy. Businesses then have all the benefits of both private and public blockchains. Think of NEO as providing the public blockchains and OnChain�s DNA providing the private blockchains. Then, they can link up and get the best of both worlds.  OnChain also has several projects and partnerships and newsworthy mentions that all contribute to the DNA ecosystem:  1. Established in 2014, this is not a fresh-off-the-shelf company  2. First Chinese blockchain company to join Hyperledger � a collaboration of projects that work towards integrating blockchain with established businesses.  3. Legal Chain � works with Microsoft China in digitizing and securing signatures via blockchain technology.  4. Strategic partner of Microsoft China on multiple projects  5. Worked with the Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry  6. Voted as KPMG�s top 50 Fintech Company in China  7. Partnership with Alibaba to provide an email certification service for Ali Cloud  8. Investment from Fosun Group�China�s largest private conglomerate � to integrate OnChain across their businesses.  9. Collaboration with Chinese regional government � using OnChain to develop public services and digital identity  OnChain�s recent development was of the ICO Ontology. Ontology uses the same architecture as NEO but ultimately works with businesses in creating a private, encrypted data network. Essentially, this is important when we have information that we need securing, but we also need it to be private. This will enable people to bring this information in a secure manner to blockchains.  References on OnChain�s roadmap  Honestly, I don�t understand why NEO doesn�t advertise their collaboration with OnChain more. NEO in itself is solid, offering several potential benefits over Ethereum. But combined with OnChain, NEO truly has the potential to implement itself as THE smart economy platform of the East.  The Ethereum Comparison: Ethereum�s equivalent is the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance, an open source blockchain initiative dedicated to linking Ethereum with the business world. Their list of partnerships is robust and impressive � no surprise for those familiar with Ethereum. Included among their members are: BP, HP, Toyota, MasterCard, Microsoft, and Intel, among many others.  TLDR: OnChain is a company partnered with NEO. They have extensive experience and many accolades in bringing blockchain to businesses. They work with companies and governments in the East. They are a huge component to NEO�s potential.  NEOX:  NEOX is NEO�s version of atomic swaps (directly swapping tokens without any exchange) and cross-chain integration. Think Ark Ecosystem. This will enable people to swap crypto assets and transact across different blockchains. It also allows smart contracts to interact across chains.  NEOX is important because it allows collaboration between the blockchains (both private and public) created by OnChain and by NEO�s public blockchain. As more components of the Smart Economy develop, NEOX will link them all together.  Ethereum Comparison: Ethereum has the ability to do atomic swaps, but has only completed this once � this isn�t to put down Ethereum; NEO has never completed one. However, Ethereum will need an outside application to accommodate large scale cross-chain integration.    Not quite the City of Zion we�re talking about�  City of Zion:  City of Zion (CoZ) is an independent, open source community of developers, translators, and designers who work towards the betterment of NEO. They have received funding from NEO to help incentivize project development. The community has contributed considerably to NEO. They have developed the NEON wallet, created a NEO block scanner, translated documents for NEO, and developed the NEX platform (see below). They recently received NEO funding to award $270,000 to 10 winners as part of their DApp competition. It is incredibly advantageous to have a network of support such as CoZ.  Ethereum Comparison: There isn�t really a good comparison for this on the Ethereum network.  NEX:  Nex is an upcoming ICO developed by City of Zion that offers a platform for the creation of payment solutions and decentralized exchanges on NEO. It links to NEO with NEOX.  Because of differences with NEO in the token model, account balances, and way smart contract interact � in comparison to Ethereum � NEO needed a solution to be able to effectively house decentralized exchanges. NEX offers that solution.  Ethereum Comparison: Already ERC20 tokens are easy to transact with on decentralized exchanges.  ProjectICO:  A turnkey, all-in-one ICO company that helps blockchain companies develop: from initial idea to ICO. They recently decided to move from Ethereum to NEO. They have an interesting Reddit AMA on their reasons for switching.  Ethereum Comparison: TokenHub is a similar project developing on Ethereum.  Microsoft China:  NEO is currently hosting a developer competition in partnership with Microsoft China with $490,000 as prize money.  Ethereum Comparison: Ethereum is incredibly well connected with established corporations. NEO is playing catchup.  DApps and ICOs:  The bread and butter of platforms; until now, NEO has only had one ICO (Red Pulse) and one DApp (AdEx). However, with several planned in the near future and with an upgrade last month which will enable NEO smart contracts to interact with website interfaces, I think this is only the beginning for NEO.  Ethereum Comparison: Ethereum hands down beats NEO in this area. Ethereum is the go-to platform for ICOs and DApps.  Ecosystem Recap  We hopefully have a strong understanding of the differences in the goals of Ethereum and NEO, as well as a good overview of NEO�s network and the network�s advantages in the smart economy. It�s important to understand this network for NEO because NEO is more than just a public blockchain, it is a piece in the larger picture. When NEO�s public blockchain can link up with OnChain�s private and business oriented blockchains and ultimately with all other DApps on it�s platform, it could truly become a smart economy.  The biggest differences between Ethereum and NEO    Ethereum�s energy consumption could power 1,025,438 American homes for a year. � Source �  Protocol  Ethereum uses the same protocol as Bitcoin � Proof of Work (PoW). With Proof of Work, computers on the network compete to solve mathematical formulas and win the right to confirm transactions into the blockchain, and thus, secure the network. The two major drawbacks to the PoW protocol is the danger of a 51% attack and the massive energy consumption required for network security. For these reasons, I think that PoW will soon be an outdated system, as blockchain transitions to a new protocol called Proof of Stake (PoS).  Proof of Stake works similarly to PoW except that instead of computers validating the network and receiving rewards equivalent to their relative computing power, PoS uses token holders. Those who hold tokens can �stake� their tokens (staking means to temporarily place the tokens in a locked smart contract?�?until staking is over) and in exchange, confirm transactions and receive rewards based on the relative number of tokens held. In PoW, if you operate 5% of the total computing power of the network, you can expect to get 5% of the block rewards. In PoS, if you own 5% of tokens, you can also expect to receive 5% of block rewards.  PoS offers a solution to the issues plaguing PoW � mainly it takes virtually no energy to run PoS � without compromising the security. I would argue that it actually improves security. With Ethereum, and all other PoW protocols, the difficulty algorithm (how hard it is to solve the mathematical formula) must constantly be updated to account for better computer hardware and more powerful mining groups. With PoS there is no need to do this. With Ethereum, you could conceivably purchase enough computing hardware to achieve a 51% attack; even after comprising the network, you would still have all of that hardware and could potentially use it to attack other PoW platforms. With PoS, because you must stake your coins, any malicious behavior results in the loss of all staked coins. So if you bought 51% of all tokens, you would immediately lose your substantial investment. In addition, the costs of purchasing 51% of the network tokens are equal for everyone. The costs of obtaining 51% of computer power � due to discounts for mass computer purchases and countries with extremely cheap electricity � are not.    Byzantine Fault Tolerance attempts to solve the Byzantine General�s Problem  NEO uses a protocol called dBFT (Delegated Byzantine Fault Tolerance) sounds like a term you�d see on your AP History Test. The simplest explanation of Byzantine Fault Tolerance is the issue with how to get everyone on the network to be honest and work together � because one bad apple could ruin everything. NEO�s dBFT is a modification of the classic PoS protocol, with some significant advantages and one primary disadvantage.  I imagine dBFT as working similar to how the U.S. Senate works (and if that analogy made you want to just give up on Neo entirely, I understand, but hold on�keep reading). If every person in America � all 323.1 million�was allowed to directly participate in the governmental decision making process, it would be catastrophic. It would be brutally slow as millions competed for the microphone, all shouting their opinion and arguing with each other. Making decisions would also be agonizingly slow. So instead, everyone in the country gets a vote. And with this vote, they can elect their representatives, someone to speak for them. This system directly reflects NEO�s governance. Instead of everyone participating in the validating process � which can be incredibly limiting in terms of transaction speed � those who hold NEO tokens can vote for delegates. These delegates (called bookkeepers) maintain the network for everyone. Thus, NEO can run faster, more efficiently, and with quicker and more finite decisions, and you can stay home, drink Bud Light, and watch the Patriots game with your computer in sleep mode.  Remember too that these bookkeepers will have their digital identity known, making NEO much more compliant with national regulations.  The disadvantage with this system is a lack of decentralization. In its purest sense, instead of thousands of validators being scattered all across the world, governance is concentrated in a few dozen validators. The majority of these nodes are currently operated by the NEO team. However, as of Quarter 1, 2018, NEO will hold less than 2/3 and will continue to hold fewer as time progresses. Regardless, NEO will never be as decentralized as other pure PoS platforms.  I would however argue that Ethereum is also not as decentralized as you might think. While the PoW protocol is decentralized, you can count the number of core developer�s for Ethereum on one hand. In addition, while I trust Vitalik Buterin, he does have enormous power and influence over the direction of Ethereum.  Ethereum will transition to a PoS protocol in the future. They already have begun the process and the mining difficulty of confirming new blocks will increase exponentially until it is impossible to mine anymore and everyone must transition to the PoS protocol. This will happen but it is likely more than a year out.  TLDR: Ethereum uses a Proof of Work protocol and will evolve into Proof of Stake. NEO uses a Delegated Byzantine Fault Tolerance (dBFT) protocol which is a modification of the standard proof of stake protocol.    Transaction Speed:  Because NEO doesn�t run on PoW and has a more streamlined PoS protocol, NEO can process transactions far more quickly than Ethereum. Now when we compare these, there are both theoretical and practical speeds. Theoretical transaction speeds are the absolute maximum speed mathematically possible for the network. For NEO, this number is 10,000tps (transactions/second). Ethereum can do 30tps. In practicality, because of real world inconsistencies and difficulties, NEO can do 1,000tps in comparison to Ethereum�s 15tps. As protocols improve it is possible that both platforms will approach their theoretical speed.  This is an enormous difference and a massive advantage for NEO. NEO�s transaction speeds could conceivably accommodate the kind of smart economy they�re envisioning; Ethereum�s can not. Now in exchange for this speed, NEO is not as decentralized as Ethereum. In addition, it�s important to recognize that Vitalik and Ethereum are well aware of this limitation. Solutions such as Raiden and sharding (two fascinating technologies but far beyond the scope of this article) are on the roadmap for Ethereum and could drastically improve Ethereum�s transaction speed.  TLDR: Ethereum can transact at 15tps with a maximum of 30tps. NEO can transact at 1,000tps with a maximum of 10,000tps. Ethereum has plans and solutions to scale to close this gap.  Forking and scaling:  Ethereum forks to update its software, just like Bitcoin. I describe this here. Forks aren�t necessarily bad, but they certainly can be. Look at Ethereum�s DAO fork for an example of this. After millions were stolen from an Ethereum smart contract, Ethereum forked to refund the money to the original holders. Whether or not this decision was correct, it divided the community and Ethereum Classic was created alongside Ethereum.  Forks happen because there is no finality in the consensus mechanism of Ethereum. Multiple chains in the blockchain can be created at once � ultimately, both are valid chains and can continued to be mined on. Forks happen constantly but are usually resolved when the chain with the most computer power is chosen as legitimate. With Ethereum, it�s always recommended that when you place a transaction, you wait until a few blocks have been mined on top of yours before considering the transaction permanent.  NEO has finality. This is because the bookkeepers must reach a 66% consensus for the transaction to be placed into the blockchain. Here is an analogy to understand this. Imagine a first grade class. Timmy asks how much chocolate milk costs. Cynthia has no concept of price (she�s in first grade for God�s sake) and shouts $15! A few students walk over to her in agreement. Bobby�s a chocolate milk aficionado � he knows his milk. He says $1.25. Most of the room walks over to him. He has a majority. Now assuming Cynthia�s group realizes their flaw and joins Bobby�s group, then the group reaches consensus. But if Cynthia is having a particularly stubborn day, she could keep on with her decision � a fork. It might not be the right answer, but she still has a valid answer. This is how Ethereum works.    Only in Israel do they have chocolate milk in a bag�  NEO works like this. Imagine the same scenario. Timmy again asks how much chocolate milk costs. First Cynthia speaks up: �$15!� A few murmur in support, but it�s clearly not 66% of the class so her idea is discarded. Next Bobby says �$1.25.� 66% of the class support his claim and thus, his idea is final. With NEO, the bookkeepers each propose the correct state of the next block. When 66% of them support the proposition, the block is finalized.  The implications of this are huge. Finality is incredibly important for the type of economy NEO hopes to support. The financial industry and other complicated, fast moving markets (stock markets for example), can�t operate on a system without finality. They need to know that when their information is placed into the blockchain, it is there for good. They also need the assurance that their blockchain won�t suddenly become irrelevant because of a fork.  TLDR: Ethereum can fork; NEO can�t � this is important for adoption by our real world economy.  Decoupling of GAS and NEO  This may very well be NEO�s most ingenious characteristic. The native token of Ethereum is ether. The gas needed to run the Ethereum network (execute contracts, conduct transactions, etc.) is actually just small units of ether. There is no separation between ether and gas.  However, NEO decoupled itself from the token needed to run the network: GAS. The NEO token is like partial ownership of the NEO platform. NEO token holders are entitled to vote for bookkeepers. NEO�s use as a share in the company rather than a token is furthered by the fact that NEO is non-divisible. NEO is not meant to be transacted with � that�s why there is GAS.  GAS is used for all operations on the NEO network. Now when a company registers or changes assets on the NEO blockchain, they pay in GAS � this GAS is then distributed to all NEO holders. Anyone can claim this GAS by just holding their NEO in a personal wallet. Such as this one: NEON  Bookkeepers are entitled to charge a transaction fee (in GAS) for general transactions on the blockchain that only they (the bookkeepers) receive. However, by decoupling NEO and GAS, there is an incentive to keep transaction fees low; here�s why:  High transaction fees, which only benefit the bookkeepers, will prevent people from wanting to register their assets on the blockchain. The less assets registered, the less rewards NEO holders will get. Thus, NEO holders are incentivized to vote in bookkeepers who will keep transaction fees low.  � Low transaction fees = more users = more assets registered = more GAS to NEO holders.� �   Malcolm Lerider   from his article:  Bookkeepers are primarily incentivized by their desire to secure the network. They use the network, benefit from it, and have money staked in NEO. Thus, it is advantageous for them to secure it.  It is unclear how rewards will be divided amongst ether holders when Ethereum becomes Proof of Stake. However, it appears that only large Ethereum holders will be able to stake and receive rewards.    The NEON Wallet with the �claim gas� button  The genius of the NEO token is that it allows users to passively acquire GAS in their wallet. No need to run the computer, keep the wallet open, or expend electricity. No need to �stake� your tokens � bookkeepers do this for you. You could even have your NEO in a paper wallet. GAS is collected when you physically push the �claim GAS� button. This also ensures that the NEO network doesn�t need to calculate the interest of NEO holders with every block, reducing traffic and simplifying the compound interest formulas. The delegated bookkeepers maintain the network; your investment gains interest. This would not be possible without two separate tokens.  Both NEO and GAS are capped at 100 million tokens.  TLDR: Ethereum has one token: ether. NEO has two: NEO and GAS. There are huge advantages to having two tokens when using a proof of stake protocol.    Source  Smart Contract Language  The biggest difference between Ethereum and NEO smart contracts is the coding language options available. With Ethereum, contracts must be written in solidity � A coding language created specifically for Ethereum. NEO on the other hand supports a variety of different languages, including the most commonly known. NEO supports five programming languages with plans to support an additional five in the future.  There are certainly advantages to crafting a particular language for a particular platform. Ethereum developers designed solidity for Ethereum. However, far fewer people know solidity. By supporting the most common coding languages, NEO has an advantage in facilitating adoption. Most programmers today would have to learn solidity before working with Ethereum whereas with NEO, their knowledge is already applicable. It�s also possible that existing business platforms could be placed onto the NEO blockchain without much modification.  TLDR (seriously? It�s like two paragraphs): Ethereum has one coding language: Solidity. NEO supports many different coding languages.  Smart Contract Execution  Smart contracts use what are called virtual machines (VM). Essentially, in layman�s terms, virtual machines are machines that execute smart contracts and run inside the computers of miners or other validators. The VM is the environment that the smart contract runs in. Thus, if we want to know how efficient and effective smart contracts can be, we need to analyze the VM.    NEO�s VM optimizes smart contract code before executing the contract. What this means is that it takes the code and reorganizes it to make it more efficient. Imagine your mom gives you a grocery list. If it�s anything like my mom�s lists � and she will probably object to this � the items have no organization and I am constantly ping-ponging back and forth across the grocery store. But by organizing all the items into categories that I can then pick up together at the same part of the store (dairy, canned goods, cereals), my job becomes much quicker and easier. NEO does this; Ethereum does not. Now while this makes things much easier in the long run, in the initial phase it takes a bit longer to organize the list. NEO�s contract execution takes slightly longer than Ethereum�s, but is much more efficient in the long run.  Ethereum plans to roll out this mechanism, but there is no timeline for it. Ultimately, this allows NEO to execute and run complex smart contracts faster and more efficiently than Ethereum.  TLDR: NEO has a more efficient and faster way of executing smart contracts than Ethereum.  Additional Important Differences  1. NEO is theoretically quantum computer resistant, Ethereum is not � When quantum computers develop enough, blockchains could be vulnerable. NEO has theoretically designed their blockchain to account for this. Ethereum does not have that capability.  2. sk-Snarks: Ethereum�s new privacy tool. sk-Snarks is the privacy protocol of ZCash. While there are far smarter people who can explain the technology far more intelligently than me, essentially sk-Snarks is important when we want to have data or contracts whose contents are private or confidential. We need to maintain the privacy of the data, but at the same time, prove we have ownership of it. sk-Snarks allows users to prove they have ownership without actually giving up the private data. NEO has no such capabilities. However, NEO�s partnership with OnChain�s Ontology offers NEO a privacy solution for businesses.  NEO�s Recipe for Success  In my opinion, NEO has two possible avenues for success. NEO�s two paths towards success are:  1. The above mentioned benefits allow it to compete with Ethereum directly and it begins to be the go-to platform for ICOs and blockchain development.  2. It doesn�t compete with Ethereum but instead becomes the DApp platform and foundation of a smart economy in the East.  The First Possibility  I think this is the least likely of the two paths to success. Yes, NEO beats Ethereum on several fronts. But Ethereum already is an established platform. And Ethereum will close the gap with its scaling plans in the future. To overtake Ethereum will be very difficult. However, I do think that NEO has a lot more room to grow, even if it can�t fully compete with Ethereum. Already we�ve seen an influx of ICOs developing on NEO � this will increase. And as it does, NEO�s price will increase. I also believe that eventually the market will support more than one platform. But that doesn�t mean NEO will ever replace Ethereum, especially in the West.  The Second Possibility � some political analysis in here too  This is definitely the most exciting of the two possibilities. Take the almost 1.4 billion Chinese; add to that an even larger untapped market in the surrounding area and that means that the blockchain platform that captures this market will make Ethereum�s $44 billion marketcap look like chump change. And as I wrote about before, China uses their own products and businesses. The issue is, we don�t even know if China is looking for a platform. Currently, China has banned all ICOs and exchanges. If the ban continues, no one will capture the Chinese ICO market � because there will be nothing to capture. So the question then is, if � and it�s a big if � China legalizes ICOs, can Neo be the big man on the block?    In my opinion, China will soon open up blockchain development. China right now sees an opportunity to be a global political and economical leader. Already with the world�s second largest GDP, China is not afraid to adapt and evolve for the benefit of their economy. Their dedication to renewable energy exemplifies this. China was certainly not known for their environmental friendliness; but they recognized that the world was moving in that direction; they recognized the benefits it offered; and they recognized the enormous potential if they could lead the pack. And now? China is the leading investor in renewable energy.  Additionally, China�s political structure means that development can happen fast. They can evolve quickly and lead world renewable energy efforts because they are a one-party state. There is no balance of power and need to appeal to a divided voter base delaying development as there is in America.  China knows that blockchain is going to be extraordinarily disruptive. They demonstrated this when they released their five-year blockchain plan. China banned exchanges and ICOs because they recognize the potential of blockchain. If they didn�t understand its significance, they never would have banned it. They banned it because they want to control it; because they will control it. They banned it to flex their muscles, establish their power, and give them time to formulate a plan for how and when they will move forward. It�s very difficult to influence things when adoption has come; it�s much easier to impose early restrictions and shape the direction of the disruption.  When they have their plan, they will likely become the world�s leading country in blockchain technology. And with the capability for rapid economic development, when China opens up ICOs and blockchain development�look out.  The question then is, what will China utilize? It�s possible that they design their own governmental blockchain services, but I think this is incredibly unlikely. China integrated with social media, not by banning it or by creating their own platform. Instead, they integrated by selectively banning western social media and directing the Chinese market to Tencent � in exchange, Tencent employs communist workers, stays regulatory compliant, and maintains the party�s censorship. And now, Tencent is bigger than Facebook. Thus, I believe that China will join the blockchain world by integrating with an already present platform; one with a willingness to work with the Chinese government; one with a focus and framework that will support governmental compliance. NEO and OnChain fit that mold. Their work and partnerships within China, NEO�s development and dedication to compliance, and their envisioned smart economy gives me confidence that when the day comes, NEO could be China�s platform.  Recognize that this is my own opinion. Nothing is guaranteed, especially in the crypto space. All we can do is formulate a hypothesis and provide a strong supporting argument; I hope that I at least did that.  Summary  Ultimately, if I had to categorize NEO and Ethereum in a few words, I would say that NEO is Ethereum but with a specific purpose: to enable a smart economy. Ethereum is just a platform to enable entrepreneurship, innovation, and development � the direction it goes is up to those individuals building on Ethereum. NEO has a direction; it is shaping its platform with a goal in mind.  Yes, NEO has some definite advantages over Ethereum, but as I said, Ethereum will likely scale to close the gap as the platform gains adoption. NEO�s true value is in its dedication towards fitting the mold for a regulatory compliant smart economy platform. They are doing this; now China just needs to takes notice.    ',\n",
       " 'The bubble. I haven�t heard the word used so much since my third grade birthday party. It is the kryptonite of every crypto investor, the most common first question, CNBC�s favorite buzzword. No matter the reporter, it�s always delivered with the same deer-in-the-headlights look and the disclaimer �we actually have no idea what we�re talking about.�  Every time I hear someone claim that cryptocurrencies are in a bubble, I fight an instinctual desire to contradict them. Like listening to someone badly misquote your favorite movie. Most make the bubble claim without any semblance of understanding of blockchain, Bitcoin, or bubbles. But while the CNBC reporter is simply throwing darts blindfolded and hoping he hits the bullseye, there may be some truth to these bubble claims.    Don�t misquote Pulp Fiction  First, the definition of a bubble: �trade in an asset at a price or price range that strongly exceeds the asset�s intrinsic value.�  There are two metrics I will use: speculation and application. We speculate on what application the asset will have, always contrasted by its actual application. The biggest bubbles always occur when the potential for disruption is enormous. This creates the largest discrepancy between the speculation and the application. This is why a new noise canceling headphone technology probably wouldn�t result in a bubble. The application of the technology is very clear � to drown out the cries of airborne babies � and thus, there�s not much room for speculation. We can base assumptions off the current headphone industry, and besides, the technology only affects one industry, so its potential for massive disruption is limited.  Consider for a minute the Internet during its onset, or especially distributed ledger technologies (DLT � a term encompassing all distributed ledger tech: DAG, HashGraph, etc.) today. The Internet threatened and has now revolutionized nearly every industry in existence. Today, DLT has the potential to do the same, disrupting industries from peer-to-peer payments, finance and the Internet-of-Things, to healthcare, contracts, and supply chains. And there is real potential. But the application is not yet there. This thus creates the environment for a massive bubble. Everyone is free to speculate wildly because there is no way to disprove it. Tell me a toaster will revolutionize the automotive industry and I�ll call bullshit. Toaster-like-technologies haven�t done it, so the speculation holds no water. But tell me DLT will disrupt the aviation industry and make a convincing argument�I can�t disprove that.    It�s undeniable that we are in a bubble.  This leads me into the following points. The key attributes of every bubble:  1. Large scale and widespread disruption  2. Very little present application  3. An asset with no underlying value � difficult to value  New theorized DLT applications will only spur more speculation. Eventually however, the application production will truly begin. Challenges will arise. Disruption will be difficult. Adoption even harder. The application implementation will rise dramatically. But because the speculation was set so exceedingly high, the application will inevitably fall short. And when it becomes clear that the application will never reach the speculation, the markets will correct�and hard. The Bubble will pop.  �and there goes the shitcoins.  We�re talking Internet bubble, great depression, first day behind the wheel crash. The markets will plummet so drastically that the speculation will suddenly be far below the application. It will suddenly be fundamentally undervalued. It will stay there for months, when, from the ashes, the strongest companies will begin leading the markets upwards again.  But unlike many who use �bubble talk� as justification for not investing, this is not my argument. We�re always in a bubble; virtually every market is just a cycle of bubble formations and pops. Even the $18.5 trillion New York Stock Exchange adheres to this cycle; as the speculation on the future of the U.S. economy rises, reality must eventually catch up. When the market over-values reality, a bubble forms. When reality fails to meet that expectation, the market crashes. These aren�t necessarily wild, 40% drops like we see in crypto, but the fact remains that bubbles are simply a natural component to investing.  So the real question is not: are we in a bubble? But rather, how big will the bubble get? If we respect the natural evolution of disruptive technology, then we must understand that with every massive speculative run-up, there is an equally massive crash. From the tulip bubble of the 1600s to the Internet bubble only 15 years ago, the crashes are inevitable. Thus, the question is, what can we learn from past bubbles, and how much can they guide our actions within the cryptocurrency market?  �Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it,� said philosopher George Santayana. And as Peter Lamborn said, perhaps more aptly, �those who understand history are condemned to watch other idiots repeat it.�  The psychological factors that lead towards enormous speculative buying are intrinsically human. They unfold similarly no matter the time period, no matter the asset. Fish gotta swim, birds gotta eat, and humans need to speculatively buy. Based on this principle, we can explore other historical bubbles to understand the present cryptocurrency bubble. Understand the reasons, understand the consequences, understand the signs, and you can better anticipate the trajectory. Be the one to pull a �Big Short.�    To be clear, my argument does not revolve around Bitcoin. If you don�t understand the difference between Bitcoin and other distributed ledger technologies, read this. Bitcoin�s value is tenuous. With slow and expensive transaction fees, Bitcoin doesn�t have much functionality; without functionality, Bitcoin�s value depends heavily on people�s perception of its value. DLT on the other hand, has serious potential applications. Since this article revolves around the speculation and application of cryptocurrency, DLT projects are where the focus should be, not on Bitcoin.  Every technological adoption follows the same curve:    The Technological Adoption Curve  It�s known as the Technological Adoption Curve. It directly relates to my earlier discussion about speculation and application. The rise through the innovator, early adopters, and early majority phases are driven by speculation. But by the time the late majority begins adopting, demand for actual implementation and application becomes critical; the implementation can�t meet the massive speculation and the crash begins.  Tulips in the 1630s exploded in Holland in what is today known as the Dutch Tulip Bubble. Historical accounts estimate that tulip prices increased 2000% within four months before crashing by 99%. In the late 1980s, a massive stimulus effort by Japan catapulted their economy and resulted in massive speculation. From Investopedia: �At the peak of the real estate bubble in 1989, the value of the Imperial Palace grounds in Tokyo was greater than that of the real estate in the entire state of California. The bubble subsequently burst in early 1990.� This was known as the Japanese Real Estate and Stock Market Bubble.  But for our comparison, the most relevant bubble is what�s commonly known as the Dot-com Bubble of the 1990s and subsequent crash in 2001�2002.  By the new millennium, it was clear that the Internet was going to change the world. It began to disrupt every industry and usher in a new economy, a new manner of conducting business, of peer-to-peer connectivity�sound familiar? The application lived up to all speculation and then some. It was likely the single most impactful, most revolutionary technological development since the Industrial Revolution; some would say even greater. Yet despite its groundbreaking success, an enormous crash still occurred.  Let�s rewind the clocks 22 years. It�s 1999 and you are a savvy investor, passionate about the internet revolution. The 6 biggest tech companies are valued at $1.65 trillion, 20% of the US�s GDP, yet you�re still constantly laughed at by your friends for investing in the new �fax machine.� Imbeciles. You know that if you do your due diligence you will find golden dot-com companies to invest in. One day one pops up on your radar. It checks all your boxes: strong team (the two founders of Borders books) and powerful institutional backing (Sequoia Capital and Benchmark Capital � later Goldman Sachs). The company is WebVan, an online grocer that promised 30 minute deliveries. In their ICO in 1999, they would raise $375 million before quickly exploding to $1.2 billion. Bullish? Disruptive? Sound familiar? Yet in July of 2001, the stock price dropped from $30 to 6 cents and WebVan lost $700 million in a day.  The Dot-Com Crash  Overall, $5 TRILLION was lost between 2000 and 2002. 25 bitcoin markets gone. Poof. Only 50% of dot-coms survived the pop, as a graveyard of startups lined Wall Street and Silicon Valley. And sad to think the internet wasn�t advanced enough to allow these people to mourn in meme form.    What Went Wrong?  In today�s world of ubiquitous connectivity and seamless experience, it is hard to imagine that the internet and its many applications once had difficulty cultivating a network of users. But in the mid 1990s, internet still had only minimal uses and yet, anything.com�s began popping up everywhere. Putting �dot com� in your company name was enough to land you a golden ticket to IPO stardom; not to mention a few hundred million.  Pets.com, Webvan, the examples are endless. Stars who burned too bright and then died. The speculation grew too fast. It outgrew its fundamental value: it�s users. The speculation of what it could be was suddenly replaced by the realization of what it was. In the long run, speculation led to overvaluation that destroyed many companies. Companies need a reality check; they need pressure and obstacles � a $500 million valuation directly after IPO does not lead to success.  Unfortunately, the poorly managed were not the only ones to suffer. Everyone plummeted. With the momentum of the crash, NASDAQ suffered. Amazon plummeted; Apple stock was decimated.    Apple stock during the crash. From a high of $4.95 per share to $1.00 just nine months later.    And a little perspective�the arrow points to the dot-com crash  Amazon crashed even more dramatically, from $85.06 in 1999 to $5.97 by 2001. When a market correction comes, no one is safe.  Same-Same but Different?  Everyone makes the dot-com / cryptocurrency comparison.. Both are/were driven by promising new technologies that are difficult to evaluate correctly. As we said earlier, bubbles are bubbles no matter the asset. However, the terms of the game have changed. 2018 is not 2000. Can we use the dot-com bubble as a viable metric? Is DLT�s future similar to that of the internet? Let�s explore the key differences between these two giants:    The Roller Coaster  If the Dot-com Bubble was your favorite Disneyland roller coaster, the digital asset market is that Sling-Shot that you�ll �definitely ride one day.� The blockchain market moves faster than any other market. It�s more volatile; life-changing gains, devastating losses.  Blockchain is like Texas, and in Texas, everything�s bigger�even the losses. Even WebVan�s doomsday of $700 million daily losses don�t scrape the surface of some crypto�s biggest losers, such as Ripple�s $25 billion rainy day on Jan 8 this year.    Ripple�s enormous volatility  These fluctuations are a result of several factors: the access investors have to cryptocurrency and the massive availability of information via the internet. This creates a perfect storm for cryptocurrency volatility. Additionally, the plethora of exchanges, both centralized and decentralized, allow for crazy arbitrage and market manipulation. Since there are very few regulations on insider trading and market manipulating in the blockchain space, one can be sure that these malicious acts are happening by the boatload. A millionaire can easily affect the price of a $5 million mkt. cap blockchain with $100k 24h volume. Whales are no strangers to these small coins, and the average small-time investor can�t differentiate between these manipulations and market sentiment.  Worldwide  Harvard�s endowment isn�t in digital assets. Your parents� retirement isn�t either (if it is, get out!). The investors today aren�t seasoned institutional investors; they�re young, inexperienced, speculative, out to get rich quick. During the 90�s NASDAQ rise, investments could only be made through brokers and by institutional investors; with cryptocurrency anyone can participate. You just need a device connected to the internet. Even a shepherd from Pakistan can become a crypto trader. What is mountain shepherding compared to the excitement of day trading?    What is the BTC/Sheep price?  These investors are accessing their portfolios 24/7, receiving twitter updates instantaneously. They don�t fully understanding the technology behind their investments. The internet provides market updates and information at a pace inconceivable before the internet. Many times, this information can be highly misleading. Other times, you�re learning from outright scams. As a result, panic selling happens frequently. Fear Of Missing Out dominates. Huge run ups are followed by massive crashes on a level far exceeding that of the Pre-2000 NASDAQ .  But this also means that the crypto bubble could dwarf the Dot-Com Bubble. NASDAQ reached a high of $5.048 trillion in March of 2000. But that high was limited by the accessibility barriers placed on investors, by the difficulties encountered when sharing information quickly and on a massive scale, and by the fact that dot-com investing was largely limited to North Americans. Cryptocurrency, accessible to anyone, from anywhere, provided they have some money and a cellphone, means that as the globe begins to understand the value of DLT, $5 trillion could look miniscule.  But this is to simply acknowledge that predicting the top of the bubble is a fool�s game. Instead, we should focus on the identifiers that scream �warning.� Here are the indicators:  1. Mass media begins focusing not only on Bitcoin (which they already are), but on DLT, on its potential, and on the associated projects. This will signify that a large portion of the population is becoming aware of the underlying technology � far different than today�s situation. CNBC is quickly making this a reality�  2. A flood of institutional money: hedge funds, retirement accounts, personal savings. This will result in a dramatic market cap increase.  3. Working blockchain products that are actually supporting large networks of users. As we progress into this development period, it will become clear that many of today�s projects are failing to live up to expectations. The first failed blockchain project will create a snowball effect.  4. A large influx of private, centralized blockchains produced by existing companies. This will demonstrate that many previously predicted, decentralized DLT solutions will in fact be overtaken by existing, traditional companies, developing their own, private blockchain solutions instead of adopting decentralized, token based platforms. This will likely result in a large reevaluation of what the reality of blockchain actually is.  5. A market cap between $5 and $10 trillion. Anything of that magnitude any time soon would be very worrying. However, it is important to understand that velocity is what creates a bubble, not total marketcap. A quick run up will almost always be followed by a dramatic crash.  Considering the fact that the public and mass media largely has no understanding of DLT supports my conclusion that we are nowhere near the top of the bubble. The world is now only beginning to legitimize Bitcoin. It will take years before the true value of blockchain is understood by the masses. In the meantime, cryptocurrency will continue to progress through periods of massive volatility. However, the general trend will be upwards � and dramatically so � as the market progresses towards its peak, and inevitably, its crash.  What differentiates last week�s crash from the ultimate �bubble popping� crash? Perhaps nothing. It�s possible that the digital asset markets will continue to rise, fall, rise, fall until the point that adoption brings stability. It could be that last week�s crash will be the most dramatic that we ever see. However, I think the significant difference is that during last week�s crash, nothing fundamental changed about the assets. The crash was entirely based on speculation and market uncertainty. I think the ultimate crash will occur because of some fundamental change in the underlying assets. This may be a series of DLT companies that cease development because of poor management or implementation hurdles. It could be that a security flaw is discovered in a number of large cap projects (IOTA anyone?). Regardless, I think in the wake of the crash, many previous blockchains will die, condemned for an eternity of existence with no further development.  Conclusion  It�s also possible that blockchain and cryptocurrency defies all predictions, all historical models. It�s possible blockchain transforms every industry and never sees a crash such that dominated the early 2000s. It�s possible that blockchain and cryptocurrency rivals today�s equity markets. It�s possible that decentralization is so dramatically different and successful that it fundamentally changes the way companies and projects develop, the way humans psychologically interact with markets. It�s possible�.but I doubt it. We may be playing a brave new game, but we have a lot to learn from the players and games that came before us.  Digital assets and DLT may very well change the world. But the journey is going to be bumpy.    ',\n",
       " 'A useful currency should be a medium of exchange, a unit of account, and a store of value. Cryptocurrencies excel at the first, but as a store of value or unit of account, they�re pretty bad. You cannot be an effective store of value if your price fluctuates by 20% on a normal day.  This is where stablecoins come in. Stablecoins are price-stable cryptocurrencies, meaning the market price of a stablecoin is pegged to another stable asset, like the US dollar.  It might not be obvious why we�d want this.  The Holy Grail of Crypto  Bitcoin and Ether are the two dominant cryptocurrencies, but their prices are volatile. A cryptocurrency�s volatility may fuel speculation, but in the long run, it hinders real-world adoption.  Businesses and consumers don�t want to be exposed to unnecessary currency risk when transacting in cryptocurrencies. You can�t pay someone a salary in Bitcoin if the purchasing power of their wages keeps fluctuating. Cryptocurrency volatility also precludes blockchain-based loans, derivatives, prediction markets, and other longer-term smart contracts that require price stability.  And of course, there�s the long tail of users who don�t want to speculate. They just want a store of value on a censorship-resistant ledger, escaping the local banking system, currency controls, or a collapsing economy. Right now, Bitcoin and Ethereum can�t offer them that.  The idea of a price-stable cryptocurrency has been in the air for a long time. Much cryptocurrency innovation and adoption has been bottlenecked around price-stability. For this reason, building a �stablecoin� has long been considered the Holy Grail of the cryptocurrency ecosystem.  But how does one design a stablecoin? To answer that question, we first have to deeply understand what it means for an asset to be price-stable.  The price of stability  All stablecoins imply a peg. Stablecoins generally peg to the US dollar (so each stablecoin trades at $1), but they sometimes peg to other major currencies or to the consumer price index.  Of course, you can�t just decide an asset should be valued at a certain price. To paraphrase Preston Byrne: a stablecoin claims to be an asset that prices itself, rather than an asset that is priced by supply and demand.  This goes against everything we know about how markets work.  This is not to say that stablecoins are impossible. Stablecoins are just currency pegs, and currency pegs are certainly not impossible � there are many currency pegs still being maintained. However, almost all large central banks have moved away from currency pegs. This is in part because they�ve realized pegs tend to be inflexible and difficult to maintain. History has taught us again and again, whether it be Mexican peso crisis of 1994, the Ruble crisis of 1998, or the infamous Black Wednesday (when George Soros �broke the bank of England�), no currency peg can be maintained against sufficiently adverse conditions.  But this is an incomplete analysis.    The reality is, any peg can be maintained, but only within a certain band of market behavior. For different pegs the band might be wider than others. But it�s straightforwardly true that within at least some market conditions, it�s possible to maintain a peg. The question for each pegging mechanism is: how wide is the band of behavior it can support?  If you assume currency markets are performing a random walk, this implies every peg will eventually walk outside of its stable band and break. But the sun will also eventually swallow up the solar system, so screw it � we can call a peg stable if it lasts 20 years. Even in fiat years, that�s pretty good.  The question for any peg then is four-fold:  1. How much volatility can this peg withstand? (Namely, downward selling pressure)  2. How expensive is it to maintain the peg?  3. How easy is it to analyze the band of behavior from which it can recover?  4. How transparently can traders observe the true market conditions?  The final two points matter a great deal, because currency pegs are all about Schelling points. If market participants cannot identify when a peg is objectively weak, it becomes easy to spread false news or incite a market panic, which can trigger further selling � basically, a death spiral. A transparent peg is more robust to manipulation or sentiment swings.  To summarize, an ideal stablecoin should be able to withstand a great deal of market volatility, should not be extremely costly to maintain, should have easy to analyze stability parameters, and should be transparent to traders and arbitrageurs. These features maximize its real-world stability.  These are the dimensions along which I�ll analyze different stablecoin schemes.  So how can you design a stablecoin?  The types of stablecoins  The more stablecoin schemes I�ve examined, the more I�ve realized how small the space of possible designs actually is. Most schemes are slight variations of one another, and there are only a few fundamental models that actually work.    At a high level, the taxonomy of stablecoins includes three families: fiat-collateralized coins, crypto-collateralized coins, and non-collateralized coins. We�ll analyze each in turn.  Fiat-collateralized stablecoins    If you want to build a stablecoin, it�s best to start with the obvious. Just create a cryptocurrency that�s literally an IOU, redeemable for $1.  You deposit dollars into a bank account and issue stablecoins 1:1 against those dollars. When a user wants to liquidate their stablecoins back into USD, you destroy their stablecoins and wire them the USD. This asset should definitely trade at $1 � it is less a peg than just a digital representation of a dollar.  This is the simplest scheme for a stablecoin. It requires centralization in that you have to trust the custodian, so the custodian must be trustworthy. You�ll also want auditors to periodically audit the custodian, which can be expensive.  But with that centralization comes the greatest price-robustness. This scheme can withstand any cryptocurrency volatility, because all of the collateral is held in fiat reserves and will remain intact in the event of a crypto collapse. This cannot be said for any other type of stablecoin.  A fiat-backed scheme is also highly regulated and constrained by legacy payment rails. If you want to exit the stablecoin and get your fiat back out, you�ll need to wire money or mail checks � a slow and expensive process.  Pros:  * 100% price-stable  * Simplest (a big virtue!)  * Less vulnerable to hacks, since no collateral is held on the blockchain  Cons:  * Centralized � need a trusted custodian to store the fiat (otherwise vulnerable to brick and mortar theft)  * Expensive and slow liquidation into fiat  * Highly regulated  * Need regular audits to ensure transparency  This is essentially what Tether purports to be, though they have not been recently audited and many people suspect Tether is actually a fractional reserve and don�t hold all of the fiat as they claim they do. Other stablecoins like TrueUSD are trying to do the same thing, but with more transparency. Digix Gold is a similar scheme, except the collateral is gold instead of fiat. Nevertheless, it shares the same fundamental properties.  Crypto-collateralized stablecoins    Say we don�t want to integrate with the traditional payment rails. After all, this is crypto-land! We just reinvented money, why go back to centralized banks and state-backed currencies?  If we move away from fiat, we can also remove the centralization from the stablecoin. The idea falls out naturally: let�s do the same thing, but instead of USD, let�s back the coin with reserves of another cryptocurrency. That way everything can be on the blockchain. No fiat required.  But wait. Cryptocurrencies are unstable, which means your collateral will fluctuate. But a stablecoin obviously shouldn�t fluctuate in value. There�s only one way to resolve this catch-22: over-collateralize the stablecoin so it can absorb price fluctuations in the collateral.  Say we deposit $200 worth of Ether and then issue 100 $1 stablecoins against it. The stablecoins are now 200% collateralized. This means the price of Ether can drop by 25%, and our stablecoins will still be safely collateralized by $150 of Ether, and can still be valued at $1 each. We can liquidate them now if we choose, giving $100 in Ether to the owner of the stablecoins, and the remaining $50 in Ether back to the original depositor.  But why would anyone want to lock up $200 of Ether to create some stablecoins? There are two incentives you can use here: first, you could pay the issuer interest, which some schemes do. Alternatively, the issuer could choose to create the extra stablecoins as a form of leverage. This is a little subtle, but here�s how it works: if a depositor locks up $200 of Ether, they can create $100 of stablecoins. If they use the 100 stablecoins to buy another $100 of Ether, they now have a leveraged position of $300 Ether, backed by $200 in collateral. If Ether goes up 2x, they now have $600, instead of the $400 they�d otherwise make.  Fundamentally, all crypto-collateralized stablecoins use some variant of this scheme. You over-collateralize the coin using another cryptocurrency, and if the price drops enough, the stablecoins get liquidated. All of this can be managed by the blockchain in a decentralized way.  We neglected one critical detail though: the stablecoin has to know the current USD/ETH price. But blockchains are unable to access any data from the external world. So how you can you know the current price?  The first way is to simply have someone continually publish a price feed onto the blockchain. This is obviously vulnerable to manipulation, but this may be good enough if the publisher is trustworthy. The second way is to use a Schelling Coin scheme, along the lines of TruthCoin. This is much more complex and requires a lot of coordination, but is ultimately less centralized and less manipulable.  Crypto-collateralized coins are a cool idea, but they have several major disadvantages. Crypto-collateralized coins are more vulnerable to price instability than fiat-collateralized coins. They also have the very unintuitive property that they can be spontaneously destroyed.  If you collateralize your coin with Ether and Ether crashes hard enough, then your stablecoin will automatically get liquidated into Ether. At that point you�ll be exposed to normal currency risk, and Ether may continue to fall. This could be a dealbreaker for exchanges � in the case of a market crash, they would have to deal with stablecoin balances and trading pairs suddenly mutating into the underlying crypto assets.  The only way to prevent this is to over-collateralize to the hilt, which makes crypto-collateralized coins much more capital-intensive than their fiat counterparts. A fiat-backed cryptocurrency will require only 100K collateral to issue 100K stablecoins, whereas a crypto-collateralized coin might require 200K collateral or more to issue the same number of coins.  Pros:  * More decentralized  * Can liquidate quickly and cheaply into underlying crypto collateral (just a blockchain transaction)  * Very transparent � easy for everyone to inspect the collateralization ratio of the stablecoin  * Can be used to create leverage  Cons:  * Can be auto-liquidated during a price crash into underlying collateral  * Less price stable than fiat  * Tied to the health of a particular cryptocurrency (or basket of cryptocurrencies)  * Inefficient use of capital  * Most complexity  The first stablecoin to use this scheme was BitUSD (collateralized with BitShares), created by Dan Larimer back in 2013. Since then, MakerDAO�s Dai is widely considered the most promising crypto-collateralized stablecoin, collateralized by Ether. An interesting scheme proposed by Vitalik Buterin is using CDOs to issue stablecoins against loans with different tranches of seniority (the most senior tranches could act as stablecoins).  Non-collateralized stablecoins    As you get deeper into crypto-land, eventually you have to ask the question: how sure are we that we actually need collateral to begin with? After all, isn�t a stablecoin just a coordination game? Arbitrageurs just have to believe that our coin will eventually trade at $1. The United States was able to move off the gold standard and is no longer backed by any underlying asset. Perhaps this means collateral is unnecessary, and a stablecoin could adopt the same model.  This idea is not completely novel � its roots can be traced to arguments made by F.A. Hayek in the 70s. A privately issued, non-collateralized, price-stable currency could pose a radical challenge to the dominance of fiat currencies. But how would you ensure it remains stable?  Enter Seignorage Shares, a scheme invented by Robert Sams in 2014. Seignorage Shares is based on a simple idea. What if you model a smart contract as a central bank? The smart contract�s monetary policy would have only one mandate: issue a currency that will trade at $1.  Okay, but how could you ensure the currency�s trading price? Simple � you�re issuing the currency, so you get to control the monetary supply.  For example, let�s say the coin is trading at $2. This means the price is too high � or put another way, the supply is too low. To counteract this, the smart contract can mint new coins and then auction them on the open market, increasing supply until the price returns to $1. This would leave the smart contract with some extra profits. Historically, when governments minted new money to finance their operations, the profits were called the seignorage.  But what if the coin is trading too low? Let�s say it�s trading at $0.50. You can�t un-issue circulating money, so how can you decrease the supply? There�s only one way to do it: buy up coins on the market to reduce the circulating supply. But what if the seignorage you�ve saved up is insufficient to buy up enough coins?  Seignorage Shares says: okay, instead of giving out my seignorage, I�m going to issue shares that entitle you to future seignorage. The next time I issue new coins and earn seignorage, shareholders will be entitled to a share of those future profits!  In other words, even if the smart contract doesn�t have the cash to pay me now, because I expect the demand for the stablecoin to grow over time, eventually it will earn more seignorage and be able to pay out all of its shareholders. This allows the supply to decrease, and the coin to re-stabilize to $1.  This is the core idea behind Seignorage Shares, and some version of this undergirds most non-collateralized stablecoins.  If you think Seignorage Shares sounds too crazy to work, you�re not alone. Many have criticized this system for an obvious reason: it resembles a pyramid scheme. Low coin prices are buttressed by issuing promises of future growth. That growth must be subsidized by new entrants buying into the scheme. Fundamentally, you could say that the �collateral� backing Seignorage Shares is shares in the future growth of the system.  Clearly this means that in the limit, if the system doesn�t eventually continue growing, it will not be able to maintain its peg.  Perhaps that�s not an unreasonable assumption though. After all, the monetary base for most world currencies have experienced nearly monotonic growth for the last several decades. It�s possible that a stable cryptocurrency might experience similar growth.    But there�s no free lunch in economics. Seignorage Shares can absorb some amount of downward pressure for a time, but if the selling pressure is sustained for long enough, traders will lose confidence that shares will eventually pay out. This will further push down the price and trigger a death spiral.  The most dangerous part of this system is that it�s difficult to analyze. How much downward pressure can the system take? How long can it withstand that pressure? Will whales or insiders prop up the system if it starts slipping? At what point should we expect them intervene? When is the point of no return when the system breaks? It�s hard to know, and market participants are unlikely to converge. This makes the system is susceptible to panics and sentiment-based swings.  Non-collateralized stablecoins are also vulnerable to a secular decline in demand for crypto, since such a decline would inevitably inhibit growth. And in the event of a crypto crash, traders tend to exit to fiat currencies, not stablecoins.  These systems also need significant bootstrapping of liquidity early on until they can achieve healthy equilibrium. But ultimately, these schemes capitalize on a key insight: a stablecoin is, in the end, a Schelling point. If enough people believe that the system will survive, that belief can lead to a virtuous cycle that ensures its survival.  With all that said, non-collateralized stablecoins are the most ambitious design. A non-collateralized coin is independent from all other currencies. Even if the US Dollar and Ether collapse, a non-collateralized coin could survive them as a stable store of value. Unlike the central banks of nation states, a non-collateralized stablecoin would not have perverse incentives to inflate or deflate the currency. Its algorithm would only have one global mandate: stability.  This is an exciting possibility, and if it succeeds, a non-collateralized stablecoin could radically change the world. But if it fails, that failure could be even more catastrophic, as there would be no collateral to liquidate the coin back into and the coin would almost certainly crash to zero.  Pros:  * No collateral required  * Most decentralized and independent (not tied to any other cryptocurrency or to fiat)  Cons:  * Requires continual growth  * Most vulnerable to crypto decline or crash, and cannot be liquidated in a crash  * Difficult to analyze safety bounds or health  * Some complexity  The most promising project in this category is Basecoin, which builds upon Seignorage Shares by adding a first-in-first-out �bond� queue. They claim that this addition improves the stability properties of the protocol, and have performed several simulations to model various outcomes.  The ideal stablecoin  Stablecoins are critical to the future of crypto. The differences between these designs are subtle, yet matter immensely.  But after having looked at many of these, my primary conclusion is that there is no ideal stablecoin. Like with most technologies, the best we can do is choose the set of tradeoffs that we�re willing to accept for a given application and risk profile.    The best outcome then, is not to try to pick winners early, but rather to encourage the many stablecoin experiments to bear their fruit in the marketplace.  If crypto has taught us anything, it�s that it�s very hard to predict the future. I suspect there are many more variations on these schemes waiting to be unearthed. But whichever stablecoins win in the long run, they�ll almost certainly build on one of these fundamental designs.    ',\n",
       " 'So you want to trade cryptocurrency?  You�ve seen those eye-popping 3000% returns and you want in.  You don�t want some measly little 10% ROI after a year in the plain old stock market. That�s for grandpas and old people. You want quit-your-job with a middle finger, fuck you money! Am I right or am I right?  Maybe you dream of being Jordan Belfort, the Wolf of Wall Street, or Gordon �greed is good� Gekko?    Or maybe your wanna be a baller, shot-caller? You want a gold-plated house, a yacht and rap video supermodels jiggling around one of your six infinity pools in string bikinis.    2 Chainz Luvs Dem Strippers!  Well have no fear because the Buddha of Wall Street is here to help you with your dreams of crypto glory! Here�s my story: I was living in a one-room apartment and sleeping in my bathtub and now I fly my helicopter to work just because I hate traffic.  All of this, and MORE, can be yours!  Come closer and I�ll tell you the ultimate, super-secret ingredient to lightning fast crypto riches!  Are you ready?  The secret ingredient is�nothing.  Wait, what?  That�s right.  There is no secret ingredient to getting rich. Anyone who tells you different is selling something.  Oh yeah and I don�t really have a helicopter�yet.  Of course, cryptocurrencies do have some of the best ROIs in history. And you do have a shot at making some good money. So let�s talk about investing in cryptos the right way.  I don�t hide the fact that I�m a long-term bull on cryptos. I believe they�re a game changing technology that will ripple across the entire world, remaking every aspect of society. Like my friend Chris Dixon, I believe Bitcoin could easily be worth $100,000 a coin one day, although I�m not quite there with perennial Dennis Hopper impersonator John McAfee�s prediction of Bitcoin going to $500K a coin, at least not in the next three years. It may take a little longer. I�ve talked about why in my articles Why Everyone Missed the Most Important Invention in the Last 500 Years and Reflections on the Best Blockchain Tweets Ever Written so I won�t rehash those reasons again.  Here we�re going to talk about cash money, y�all. Unlike many folks in this space, trading is not my primary interest, but like everyone I do enjoy making money.  How do you make money with cryptocurrencies?  Carefully.  Questions, Questions  The very first question you need to ask yourself is, do you have enough extra money to invest?  What does extra money mean?    Surprisingly, the SEC has some good guidance here. Even though they let Bernie Madoff get away with a massive pyramid scheme for a decade, despite someone telling them about it every year, they�re occasionally good for something! While, I�m not a big fan of the nanny-state accredited investor rules of the SEC that let�s only rich people invest as they see fit, nor of the �pattern day trader� rule that requires to you to have $25,000 minimum in order to day trade the traditional markets (which, by the way, does not apply to crypto markets�yet), there is some merit to the rules. Those numbers are arbitrary bullshit but I do agree with the sentiment that led to the creation of those laws.  They�re trying to protect people from losing money they don�t have to lose.  And since the nanny-state is not here to protect you in the crypto markets you will just have to go ahead and take personal responsibility and protect yourself.  While stories like I Invested All My Spending Money In Ethereum (And so Did All My Friends) are funny on some level (college kids can afford to take some risks because they have a lot of life left to recover later if they lose everything) they�re also utterly terrifying on another level. What if that girl lost all her food money for the year? Not awesome.  I can�t find the tweet now, but just the other day I saw a guy posting about how he mortgaged his car, lost it all trading cryptos and his wife kicked him out. He was looking to get in on a �shit coin pump� aka where traders get together and buy like crazy to pump a penny-stock equivalent to the moon before dumping it on idiots. Not good. Do not be that guy.  Only invest what you can afford to lose.    Copyright � Cagle.com.  If you don�t have a lot of money, start small. Don�t go maxing out your credit cards or getting a �loan� from that guy your bother knows who sits on the corner outside the bodega on 156th and Broadway. You�ll only get burned.  The second question you have to ask yourself is:  Are you a buy-and-holder or a trader?  These are two very, very different things.  By a wide margin, the right strategy for most people is to just buy and hold. Get some well know cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dash, or Litecoin, put them in cold storage, stick them in the sock drawer and forget about them. Don�t read the news. Don�t worry about the wild swings or the predictions of doom from the popular press. Just buy, hold and forget. In a year or two, dig them out and sell some of them and buy a little more with the proceeds. Wash, rinse and repeat until retirement.  If you want to trade however, that is a different beast all together. That means you�re looking to get in and out of the market. The rules of the game are simple:  Buy low, sell high.  Duh, you say.  Easier said than done though.  There are two parts to this game:  * Making money  * Keeping it  Most people crash and burn on the second part. Everyone makes money in a bull market and then most give it right back afterwards.  So does that mean you shouldn�t trade? No way. I love trading!  On the days you win, it�s the ultimate rush. You�re a Viking raider, swooping in on unsuspecting villagers and mowing them down with glee.  On bad days though, it�s brutal. You�ll lose sleep, hair, friends and money. You�ll be depressed, angry, and scattered brained.  So why play at all?  Because trading is the ultimate game.  You�re playing against other people, with incomplete information, on an occluded battlefield, as well as against the maniacal and sadistic �mind� of the market, and against yourself. Your mental strength, emotions and belief systems are all working against you. That business school bullshit they taught you about rational actors with perfectly distributed information making rational decisions in the marketplace is just that, utter and complete bullshit.  Anyone who spends five fucking minutes trading knows it�s crap.  The markets are not rational. Nor are people. We are fear based, emotional creatures.  Only an ivory tower academic economist would ever think something so utterly ridiculous.  First of all, the information is not even close to evenly distributed. We�re all playing with partial information and a fog of war. Even worse, we all have varying degrees of ability to process that information. Meaning all of us are kind of stupid. If you�re not that bright, it doesn�t matter how much info you have, you won�t be able to do shit with it. Go directly to Dunning-Kruger and do not pass go.  And most of us are not that bright.  All of us have stupid, magical belief systems and broken mental heuristics that work against us every single second of our lives.    If you ask a group of people how many of them are �above average� drivers, almost everyone will raise their hands. This is impossible. We can�t all be above average but we all believe we are.  Even if you�re a good trader, you�re not immune to this kind of mental insanity. If you think you are, that�s another magical belief. As I wrote this article, I made not one but two stupid BTC trades and busted out trying to catch today�s insane $600 a coin rally late.  I knew this was a terrible idea.  I did it anyway.  I was writing this article (not focused) and I was late to the party, a double whammy of stupid. Rule number one: If you miss a trade, stay the hell out of the market. Get �em next time.  But did I listen? Nope. Because I am an emotional fear based creature just like everyone else. FOMO (Fear of missing out) got me. The force is strong with FOMO and not you or anyone else is immune to it. No matter how good you get, you�ll regularly and repeatedly shoot yourself in the foot.  When I used to trade the regular markets, I can�t tell you how often I saw good, professional traders (I�m looking at you Slope of Hope) saying �this makes no sense, the market is wrong.�  No, the market is always right.  You are wrong.  You�re either in line with it and making money or you�re losing money and bitching about how the market should be more rational.  The problem is most of us are seeing a movie in our heads about life, instead of what�s actually right in front of our noses. To the degree that reality doesn�t match up with what we want to think about it, we go with what we want to think about it. For most humans giving up their belief systems is the same thing as death. They would rather die, literally, than change their mind.  That doesn�t work for the market. The markets are a lesson in humility. You will learn to see things as they actually are versus how you imagine them to be or you will get taken out to the woodshed and beaten with a rubber hose. In other words you will lose all your money just like that idiot who sold his car to play the markets. The markets are economic Darwinism and they have no mercy.    Let me give you an example of how your belief systems work against you in the game of coins.  One of the traders I follow closely is the Wolf of Poloniex. In full disclosure, I am not a member of his �Wolf Pack� currently, which is his paid private trading signals group. I just follow the big market moves he posts about on Twitter. That�s because, in general, I prefer to do my own research, trust my own eyes and live with my own calls, right or wrong.  The Wolf is a fast, aggressive trader and that matches nicely with my personal style. His calls regularly make me tons of money. A question you have to ask of all traders is �are they right?� Nobody is right all the time. In fact, even the best of the best are wrong more than they�re right. The greatest traders make their money on 20% of their trades. The rest of our trades make only modest gains or loses.  So how can we know whether someone is right or wrong, objectively?  Simple.  Either my bank account is going up or its going down.  That�s it.  It�s a perfect system. Binary. You win or lose. There is no in between.  If my bank account is going up, and I�m following his calls closely, then he�s right. If I keep losing money on his calls, he�s wrong.  But most people don�t see it that way. Lots of folks think the guy�s calls are absolute shit. Why is that?  Because the Wolf has an in-your-face persona that rubs many people the wrong way. He loves to stick it to people who say he�s wrong. Any time he posts a call, people are quick to pounce on him and call him an idiot, a douchebag and a shill hucking trading calls. They want him to fail.  The reason is because they�re unable to disconnect his calls from his persona. They conflate two unrelated things. Whether he�s likable or not is utterly irrelevant. Personally I like the dude but that�s irrelevant too. Except people can�t and won�t see it that way.    People get very attached to their opinions. Burn your opinions! Your opinions mean nothing to the market.  If you thought a bull market was starting and it turns into a bear, your opinion was wrong. Period. Let it go! Move on! But people love their opinions. They cling to them desperately.  We�re just wired that way.  Our brains are littered with mental pitfalls.  Being �right� when you�re wrong is great way to lose money.  Do you know that at times as much as 38% of the population can�t tell you which party is more conservative in America. 38%! In fact, most people don�t vote based on actual politics at all. They pick who they like the most and then project their viewpoints onto that person, even if that person has diametrically opposed ideas to their own.  How fucking stupid is that?  Welcome to the human race.  We�re prone to all kinds of crazy-ass mental nonsense.  So with that kind of broken grey matter, how the hell can we expect to get good at trading?  Is there any hope?  Yes.  Getting Good at Trading  To start with, you better start reading.  We all have a lot to learn and the sooner we start doing it, the better we get. Your goal is to learn something every day for the rest of your life.    My current favorite book on trading is the super simple Top 10 Trading Setups: How to Find them, When to Trade Them, How to Make Money with Them. Like all trading books, I prefer the paper copy, as opposed to the Kindle edition, as the chart pictures are easier to see.  This book is short and to the point. There are no stories of the author�s trading glory, or links to his special, ultra secret system that you can have for a mere thousand dollars more. It concentrates on simple, practical advise, for multiple market trends. Everyone makes money when it�s all going up but how do you deal with trades going sideways or down? It�s in there.  While the book is focused on traditional markets, most of the rules he puts forward can easily be applied to the crypto markets. His reasons for why new traders lose money on the very first page is worth the price of the entire book.  New traders lose because they:  * Trade too big  * Trade without an edge, or in other words � gamble  * Over trade  * Trade low price junk stocks  * Use excessive leverage.  Trading with leverage in the cryptos is like juggling Cobras. Don�t fucking do it if you�re not a professional trader. The crypto markets move too fast and you can easily lose someone else�s money that you don�t have to pay back. Not good.  That brings us to the one major difference between the regular and the crypto markets.  Crypto markets move at video game speed.    When he talks about how a market might take weeks or months to play out, in the parallel universe of crypto trading, that could play out in days. We literally just saw the market crash out 40%, going full bear, and then recover in two days to new heights. That�s how fast it moves.  This is one of the reasons the popular press does not understand cryptos. They regularly report that Bitcoin is over and dead for good. It�s hilarious. Check out this article from 99 Bitcoins. Someone writes Bitcoin�s obituary every day.  The problem is the pop-press is used to playing the game at slower speeds. It�s as if they were good football players in college only to go to the pros and have guys blow right past them. It�s a totally different level. This is the e-Sports universe.  Cryptos are the computer generation�s stock market.  It�s run by kids who never lived life without the Internet. To them it�s just like a tree, it was always there. The NYSE come from the days of ink and wood pulp. When Forbes or CNN or FOX reports on bear markets in the traditional stock world, they�re usually right for a reasonable period. That market will go cold for months. In crypto it could go nova hot tomorrow.  It�s warp speed.  To keep up your need an edge. That brings us to book number two:    Encyclopedia of Chart Patterns.  This book is a monster. It�s heavy and dense and filled with information. After reading it you�ll likely start seeing patterns everywhere, even when they don�t exist. Don�t worry. Study them anyway. You�ll regularly see people drawing random lines on the chart on Twitter and calling it �technical analysis� but this book is much more disciplined and serious.  Technical Analysis (aka studying the chart patterns) works pretty damn well in crypto trading. My gut tells me it�s because most of the folks trading cryptos are geeks and we�re prone to liking TA because it makes sense to the engineer brain. That makes them a self-fulfilling prophesy. It also works because there�s lots of machine trading going on. You�ll be trading against bots regularly on the exchanges and they have no choice but to make decisions based on moving averages, pull backs, breakouts and all the other things that TA aficionados love.  The other reason it works is because TA is all about psychology. People want to take gains and cut losses. After a certain amount of rise, it�s going to fall. It�s just natural.  The markets are really nothing but the shared hallucination of our collective unconscious, the projection of our hopes, dreams and fears.  Remember though, TA is not a magic eight ball.  It does not work all the time. It�s often just junk voodoo. It�s hard to do right, easy to do wrong and prone to all kinds of false signals. Still, it�s a useful tool. It�s saved me a number of times and helped me avoid big crashes.    The last book on my list is one I�ve always loved: One Up on Wall Street, by legendary investor Peter Lynch. Yeah that Lynch, the one with his name on the marquee. He beat the market for fifteen years. Statistically most traders bust out after ten years. A lot of the advice in the book, like making sure you buy a home before investing in stocks, is outdated. Homes are regularly a huge money pit of debt for today�s young people. But his investing advice is timeless and applies to any market.  How did he make his mulah? Like Warren Buffet, he focused on �value investing.� What�s that you ask? Excellent question, young Padawan.  He invested in what he knew and understood. When his wife or kids came home with a shopping bag from a new store, he�d research that company and buy it. He figured if people were buying from it, it was a good company.  Investing in what you know is a great mental heuristic. Warren Buffet regularly refuses to invest in all kinds of companies, like the tech stars everyone loves, because he doesn�t understand tech. Because he doesn�t understand it he can�t make a good call ahead of time, so he stays out. If you don�t understand the purpose of a coin, stay out. Don�t buy it because it�s going to the moon and some jackass in a Slack forum told you it�s killer.  In crypto, value investing means not buying a bunch of shit coins. ICOs happen all the time and new coins pop onto the market, promising great returns. Some of them will deliver one day. But most of those coins will go to nothing in the next few years.  Personally, I tend to invest in �infrastructure� coins or coins that have a chance to be multifaceted and serve lots of purposes. I have a background in building systems because I was a systems administrator for more than a decade. I�m looking for the folks building the railroad tracks of tomorrow.  Ethereum, Bitcoin, QTUM, and Tezos have multiple purposes. Pot Coin does not.  Over the years, like all good traders, Peter Lynch made all his money on 20% of his �home run� trades and lost or made modest returns on 80% of his trades.  80/20 is the formula.  You will never do better than that, even if you manage it for a number of years. Eventually you�ll revert to the mean. That�s statistics baby. And math is God. It runs things around here and everywhere else.  And of course, even after you read all these books, try to remember:  There is no secret ingredient.  Actually, there is.  The secret ingredient is you.  It�s cheesy but it�s true.  The way to get better is to get in the game. There is no substitute for personal experience. There�s an old saying in the ancient game of Go.    Attack and Defense  �To learn Go, first lose 100 games fast.�  This is true of everything in life.  You have to get into the arena. You�ve got to play the game. Without skin in the game you won�t learn a damn thing.  It�s one thing to read about something in a book, and another thing entirely to do it.  When the pressure is on and your emotions are against you and you�re watching thousands of dollars vaporizing in minutes and you�re fighting with your significant other and absurdly blaming her for taking you to dinner and �causing� you to lose money (magical belief) because you weren�t watching the trading screen like a hawk, then you�ll understand.  This ain�t no joke.  This is not hypothetical. This happened to me last week.  But every day I learn.  Oh and I did make money. I was just mad I didn�t make more. That�s when I knew I needed to take a break and do nothing for a day. I got up late, took a walk, ate a nice breakfast and apologized for being a jerk to my beautiful lady.  You have to recharge. You don�t need to catch every damn run. Go out. See the trees, listen to the birds, play with your kids and your pets. In short, do the things that matter in life. The markets will be waiting for you when you return.  Here�s the deal: You�ll make mistakes. And you�ll learn. That�s the only way.    TR got in the arena and you should too.  But if you let this amazing and legendary quote by the great Teddy Roosevelt be your guide to trading and to life and if you�re lucky, you just might do OK in the world:  �It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.�    ',\n",
       " 'For those new to the blog, I am the lead developer of Sia, a blockchain based cloud storage platform. About a year ago, myself and some members of the Sia team started Obelisk, a cryptocurrency ASIC manufacturing company. Our first ASICs are going to ship in about 8 weeks, and our journey with Obelisk has given us a lot of insight into the world of cryptocurrency mining.  One of the reasons we started Obelisk was because we felt that coin devs in general had a very poor view into the mining world, and that the best way to understand it would be to get our hands dirty and bring a miner to market.  Since starting Obelisk, we�ve learned a lot about the mining space, as relevant to GPUs, to ASICs, to FPGAs, to ASIC resistance, mining farms, electricity, and to a whole host of other subjects that coin developers should be more aware of. We aren�t able to share everything that we know, but we�ve pulled together information on a set of key topics that I think will be helpful to cryptocurrency designers and other members of the cryptocurrency community.    ASIC Resistance  We�ve been pessimistic on ASIC resistance for a long time, and our journey into the hardware world solidly confirmed our position. Hardware is extremely flexible. General purpose computational devices like CPUs, GPUs, and even DRAM all make substantial compromises to their true potential in order to be useful for general computation. For basic hardware development, most algorithms can see substantial optimization just by taking away all of that generality and focusing on one specific thing.  The vast majority of ASIC-resistant algorithms were designed by software engineers making assumptions about the limitations of custom hardware. These assumptions tend to be incorrect.  Equihash is perhaps the easiest target, as a lot of people were quite confident in the equihash algorithm, and we�ve been saying for close to a year that we know how to make very effective equihash ASICs.  The key is to make sorting memory. A lot of algorithm designers don�t seem to realize that in an ASIC, you can merge the computational and storage pieces of a chip. When a GPU does equihash computations, it has to go all the way out to off-chip memory, bring data to the computational cores, manipulate the data, and then send the altered data all the way back out to the off-chip memory.  For equihash, the manipulations that you need to make to the data are simple enough that you can just merge the memory and computation together, meaning that you can do most of your manipulating in-place, substantially reducing the amount of energy used to move data back and forth, and also substantially decreasing the amount of time between adjustments to the data. This greatly increases efficiency and speed.  Needless to say, we weren�t the least bit surprised when Bitmain released powerful ASICs for equihash. The Bitmain ASICs are actually substantially less performant (5x to 10x) than our own internal study suggested they would be. There could be many reasons for this, but overall we think that it�s pretty reasonable to assume that more powerful equihash ASICs will be released in the coming months.  We also had loose designs for ethash (Ethereum�s algorithm). Admittedly, ethash was not as easily amenable to ASICs as equihash, but as we�ve seen from products on the market today, you can still do well enough to obsolete GPUs. Ethash is by far the most ASIC resistant algorithm we�ve looked at, most of the others have shortcuts that are even more significant than the shortcuts you can take with equihash.  At the end of the day, you will always be able to create custom hardware that can outperform general purpose hardware. I can�t stress enough that everyone I�ve talked to in favor of ASIC resistance has consistently and substantially underestimated the flexibility that hardware engineers have to design around specific problems, even under a constrained budget. For any algorithm, there will always be a path that custom hardware engineers can take to beat out general purpose hardware. It�s a fundamental limitation of general purpose hardware.    Hardfork Resistance  A lot of people believe that computing is broken up into 3 categories: CPU, GPU, and ASIC. While those are the categories that are generally visible to the public, in the chip world there�s really only one type of chip: an ASIC. Internally, Nvidia, Intel, and other companies refer to their products as ASICs. The categories as known to the public are really a statement about how flexible the ASIC is.  I would like to use a 1 to 10 scale to measure flexibility. At one side, a �1�, we�ll put an Intel CPU. And at the other side, a �10�, we�ll put a bitcoin ASIC. Designers have the ability to create chips that fall anywhere on this scale. As you move from a �1� to a �10�, you lose substantial flexibility, but gain substantial performance. You also decrease the amount of design and development effort required as you sacrifice flexibility. On this scale, a GPU is a �2�.  Generally speaking, we don�t see products developed that fall anywhere between a GPU and a fully inflexibile ASIC because typically by the time you�ve given up enough flexibility to move away from a GPU, you�ve only got a very specific application in mind and you are willing to sacrifice every last bit of flexibility to maximize performance. It�s also a lot less costly to design fully inflexible ASICs, which is another reason you don�t see too many things in the middle.  Two examples of products between a GPU and an ASIC would be the Baikal miners and the Google TPU. These are chips which can cover a flexible range of applications at performances which are substantially better than a GPU. The Baikal case specifically is interesting, because it�s good enough to obsolete GPUs for a large number of coins, all using the same basic chip. These chips appear to be flexible enough to follow hardforks as well.  The strategy of hardforking ASICs off of a network is going to lose potency the more it happens, because chip designers do have the ability to make chips that are flexible, anywhere from slightly flexible to highly flexible, with each piece of flexibility costing only a bit of performance. The Monero devs have committed to keeping the same general structure for the PoW algorithm, and because of that commitment we believe that you could make a Monero miner capable of surviving hard forks with less than a 5x hit to performance.  Equihash is an algorithm that has three parameters. Zcash mining happens with one particular choice for these parameters, and any naive hardfork from Zcash to drop ASICs would likely involve changing one or more of these parameters. We were able to come up with a basic architecture for equiahsh ASICs that would be able to successfully follow a hardfork that chose any set of parameters. Meaning, a basic hardfork tweaking the algorithm parameters would not be enough to disrupt our chip, a more fundamental change would be needed. Despite this flexibility, we believe our ASIC would be able to see massive speedups and efficiency gains over GPUs. We never found funding for the equihash ASICs, and as a result our designs ended up on the shelf.  The ultimate conclusion here once again wraps back to the capabilities of ASICs. I think there are a lot of people out there who do not realize that flexible ASICs are possible, and expected that routinely doing small hardforks to disrupt any ASICs on the network would be sufficient. It may be sufficient sometimes, but just as algorithms can attempt to be ASIC resistant, ASICs can attempt to be hardfork resistant, especially when the changes are more minor.    Monero�s Secret ASICs  A few months ago, it was publicly exposed that ASICs had been developed in secret to mine Monero. My sources say that they had been mining on these secret ASICs since early 2017, and got almost a full year of secret mining in before discovery. The ROI on those secret ASICs was massive, and gave the group more than enough money to try again with other ASIC resistant coins.  It�s estimated that Monero�s secret ASICs made up more than 50% of the hashrate for almost a full year before discovery, and during that time, nobody noticed. During that time, a huge fraction of the Monero issuance was centralizing into the hands of a small group, and a 51% attack could have been executed at any time.  Monero�s hardfork appears to have been successful in shaking the ASICs. I don�t believe that the ASIC designers attempted to build flexibility into their ASICs, but now that Monero has announced a twice-annual PoW change, we may see another round of secret ASICs with more flexibility. The block reward for Monero is high enough that even if you think you have only a 30% chance of your ASIC surviving the PoW hardfork, it�s more than worthwhile to pursue a hardfork resistant ASIC.  My strong guess is that Monero is going to have another round of secret ASICs built, and that these ASICs will be more conservative and flexible, attempting to follow the hard forks that Monero puts out every 6 months.    Other Secret ASICs  We�ve heard rumors of plenty of other secret ASICs. People who own secret ASICs tend not to talk about them very much, but as of March 2018, we had heard of secret ASIC rumors specifically for both Equihash and Ethash, and then for many other smaller coins that don�t have any ASICs on them yet. We believe a full 3 different groups were actively mining on Zcash with different ASICs prior to the Bitmain Z9 announcement.  We know of mining farms that are willing to pay millions of dollars for exclusive access to designs for specific cryptocurrencies. Even low ranking cryptocurrencies have the potential to make millions in profits for someone with exclusive access to secret ASICs. As a result, an informal underground industry has been set up around secret mining. The heavy amount of secrecy involved means it�s disconnected and mostly operates off of rumor and previous relationships. But it�s nonetheless a very lucrative industry, and even when things happen like the Vertcoin hardfork, the setback to secret miners is dwarfed by the returns of the successes.  At this point, I think it�s safe to assume that every Proof-of-Work coin with a block reward of more than $20 million in the past year has at least one group of secret ASICs currently mining on it, or will have secret ASICs mining on it within a few months. The easiest way to detect this is GPU returns, however as ASICs continue to infiltrate every coin on the market, that will cease to be a reliable metric as there will be no GPU-only coin to use as a baseline, at least not one that is large enough to sustain all of the massive GPU farms that are out there.  The ASIC game has become such an advanced game because there is so much money on the table. Even small coins can be worth tens of millions of dollars, which is more than enough to justify a high-risk production run.    Manufacturer Exposure  Manufacturers that sell ASICs to the public, like Bitmain, tend to be less exposed than consumers to things like ASIC hardforks. Using Sia as an example, we estimate it cost Bitmain less than $10 million to bring the A3 to market. Within 8 minutes of announcing the A3, Bitmain already had more than $20 million in sales for the hardware they spent $10 million designing and manufacturing. Before any of the miners had made any returns for customers, Bitmain had recovered their full initial investment and more.  In this case, a hardfork doesn�t hurt Bitmain. Bitmain made a profit off of Sia, and there�s nothing the developers can do about that. And it seems that was the case for the Monero miners that Bitmain announced as well. Bitmain didn�t even get to announce the miners until after Monero announced their hardfork, and still it seems that they sold enough obsolete hardware to customers to make back their costs and turn a hearty profit.  The mining game is weighted heavily in favor of the manufacturers. They get to control the hardware production, the supply, and they know more about the state of the industry than anyone else. The profitability of a miner largely depends on variables that the manufacturer controls without disclosure to anyone else.  In the case of Halong�s Decred miner, we saw them �sell out� of an unknown batch size of $10,000 miners. After that, it was observed that more than 50% of the mining rewards were collecting into a single address that was known to be associated with Halong, meaning that they did keep the majority of the hashrate and profits to themselves. Our investigation into the mining equipment strongly suggests to us that the total manufacturing cost of the equipment is less than $1,000, meaning that anyone who paid $10,000 for it was paying a massive profit premium to the manufacturer, giving them the ability to make 9 more units for themselves. Beyond this, the buyer has no idea how many were sold nor where the difficulty would be when the units shipped. The manufacturer does know whether or not the buyer is going to be able to make a return, but the buyer does not. The buyer is trusting the manufacturer entirely.  If a cryptocurrency like Sia has a monthly block reward of $10 million, and a batch of miners is expected to have a shelf life of $120 million, the most you would expect a company could make off of building miners is $120 million. But, manufacturers actually have a way to make substantially more than that.  In the case of Bitmain�s A3, a small batch of miners were sold to the public with a very fast shipping time, less than 10 days. Shortly afterwards, YouTube videos started circulating of people who had bought the miners and were legitimately making $800 per day off of their miner. This created a lot of mania around the A3, setting Bitmain up for a very successful batch 2.  While we don�t know exactly how many A3 units got sold, we suspect that the profit margins they made on their batch 2 sales are greater than the potential block reward from mining using the A3 units. That is to say, Bitmain sold over a hundred million dollars in mining rigs knowing that the block reward was not large enough for their customers to make back that money, even assuming free electricity. And this isn�t the first time, they pulled something similar with the Dash miners. We call it flooding, and it�s another example of the dangerous asymmetry that exists between manufacturers and customers.  At the end of the day, cryptocurrency miner manufacturers are selling money printing machines. A well-funded profit maximizing entity is only going to sell a money printing machine for more money than they expect they could get it to print themselves. The buyer needs to understand why the manufacturer is selling the units instead of keeping them for themselves.  There are a few reasons it would make sense for a manufacturer to sell a money printing machine rather than keep it. The first is capital � manufacturing is an expensive process with a lot of lead times. If the manufacturer doesn�t have enough money to build their own units, then it makes sense to sell the units instead, and use the money from sales for production. It boils down to the manufacturer selling future revenue to get revenue today, which is a very common transaction in the financial world.  Another reason the manufacturer may sell money printing machines instead of running them is the electricity costs of running them. If the manufacturer can only get a certain deal on electricity, then there may be someone else with cheaper electricity or better datacenters who would be willing to buy the units at a price that�s higher than what the manufacturer values them at. Most manufacturers however have access to good electricity deals, and unless you have some deal with free electricity or are otherwise running a cutting edge professional operation, you are not likely to do better than the manufacturer.  And finally, the manufacturer may have some other reason that they want money quickly instead of making a longer term investment into the hardware themselves. This is likely not the case in cryptocurrency mining though, because the shelf life of miners tends to be under two years, and to a business that�s not a long time at all to wait for healthy returns.    Manufacturer Agility  In the traditional chip development world, it takes about 2 years to go from launching a development effort to getting a chip out out the door. In the case of the Sia and Decred miners we built, it looks like we�re going to be at about 13 months total from project launch to product delivery. If we had to do the same thing again, I think we could do it in about 9 months.  A huge portion of the time spent is on full-custom routing for the chip. There�s a much faster development process called place-and-route which trims about 3 months off of the chip development time, but produces chips that are 2x-5x slower than what a full-custom team can produce. We think that if we used a place-and-route design methodology, we could get our product delivery timeline close to 6 months.  We believe it took Bitmain about 5 months to create the A3 miner, and we believe it took Halong about 9 months to create the B52 miner. We suspect both of these were completed using place-and-route methodologies, especially given the relatively poor performance of each.  Those are timelines for creating a chip from scratch. If the goal is to chase a hardfork, the timelines are a lot shorter. If you know in advance that you are going to need to redesign your chip, there are a lot of shortcuts you can take to reduce the overall time required to get to market. Changing a design to meet a tweak is going to take much less time than starting from scratch, a good team with a well-planned base architecture can probably complete designs in about 2 weeks. From there, with some help from a hot-lot, you can get a new set of chips in about 40 days. These then need to be packaged, which is going to take around a week, and then sent to the manufacturer for assembly. Finally, you have to get the units to a datacenter and start mining.  If you had all the wafers, parts, and everything reserved ahead of time, we believe that you could upgrade a chip to adapt to a hardfork and have miners mining on the new hashing algorithm in about 70 days, at least in theory. In practice, Bitmain would probably require 3�4 months to adapt an existing chip to a hard fork, and if they hadn�t reserved wafers in advance they�d be looking at 4�5 months. Any company that is not Bitmain can probably add another 30�60 days to these numbers.    Economies of Scale  Some people already understand the situation with economies of scale well. The more money you spend, the more effective each dollar is. This effect is maintained throughout every level of scale that I�ve been able to peer into, including scales where you are going from billions of dollars to tens of billions of dollars.  The most simple way that this manifests is in volume orders. If you order one hundred thousand heatsinks, you can get one price. If you order one million heatsinks, you get a better price. As you continue to scale up, the price falls off. This effect is in place for almost all parts in the hardware industry, and it happens because manufacturers get to the point where they can buy and dedicate equipment to your order, and then keep that equipment at 100% efficiency. As you scale up, you gain greater customization and specialization in addition to cost savings, meaning your products become more effective as well as cheaper.  At some point, it makes sense just to buy out all the capacity at the manufacturer. A huge component of manufacturing price is paying for equipment. Equipment that is idle 50% of the time is going to have 2x the effective per-part price than equipment that is in use 100% of the time. As you increase lead times and order volumes, you can start getting fully dedicated equipment running nonstop for you, which again pulls the price down substantially.  In a similar sort of turn, someone has to manufacture that equipment. If you scale up to the point where you are continuously ordering specific equipment, the manufacturer can start to dedicate pipelines to you and keep their own equipment operating 100% of the time, and so the equipment you use for manufacturing is getting cheaper now on top of being in use all the time.  And that�s just the beginning. At every step, each provider, manufacturer, etc. is going to be taking margins, typically somewhere around 30% depending on how commodity your orders are. If you have enough money, you can start to engage in vertical integration, cutting out the margins of your manufacturers by either buying them out or creating your own margin-free entity.  Hardware goes through a lot of steps. There�s the acquisition of raw materials like iron and oil, the refinement of these materials, and then they get manufactured into base parts that can be sold for more general products. Those base parts often have lead times that are 6+ months, which means that suppliers typically keep a huge number of them in stock, so that they can provide customers with parts on faster timelines. Every step typically introduces both a middleman and inefficiency, especially because each step is targeted towards general use parts instead of a specific product. If you have a specific product that has enough volume / scale to justify dedicated supply chain elements, you will shave costs, you will shave lead times, you will improve product quality and performance, and you will get ahead of what anyone without that type of scale can achieve.  To present a very rough number, it seems to me that every time you 10x the amount of money you are spending, you can save about 30% per part. That is to say, if you are spending $100 million on mining units, you might get units for $500 each. And if you are spending $1 billion on mining units, you can squeeze that price down to $350 per miner just by having more money to throw around. And then if you jump to $10 billion, your per-miner price might drop to $245. Your mining machines aren�t just getting cheaper though, they are also becoming more customized and higher performance. You don�t just build a dollar moat with scale, you also build a quality moat.    Playing Dirty  When we started Obelisk, we had numerous separate sources reach out and warn us that Bitmain plays dirty, and that if we try to manufacture in China, we will be stopped.  With that in mind, we brought up the issue to everyone we worked with, and proceeded cautiously with an American manufacturer that owned a facility in China. This was attractive because the prices were close to half of what we would have paid to manufacture in America, and manufacturing was going to be one of our largest expenses by far.  We did everything we could to keep the entity disconnected from Obelisk, and we hid the name of the manufacturer from our website or any public data, and we were very careful with who we gave the name of our manufacturer privately. We had a separate entity put in parts orders where we could.  After any reasonable timeframe to reach out to another manufacturer, after-hours on a Friday night, our manufacturer reached out to us and said with little warning or reasonable explanation that they would be unable to manufacture for us. Just as we had been warned, our attempt to manufacture in China had fallen flat on its face. This setback is estimated to have cost us somewhere north of $2 million.  We have absolutely no evidence that Bitmain was involved in any way. We�ve had other companies reach out to us and confirm that they�ve experienced similar things, but they too had no concrete evidence that Bitmain was involved in any way. I honestly was not sure whether to include this section in the blog post, because unlike most of the other things I�ve been saying, we really have nothing more than a bunch of warnings that ended up being correct to inform us.  But it�s well established in the industry that Bitmain plays dirty, and it�s been suggested to us from all sides that they have been and will continue making moves within our supply chain to ensure we can�t succeed, and that they do the same with all of their competitors.  Mining Farms  Mining farms are perhaps the one area where manufacturers and economies of scale are not dominant. Good electricity deals tend to come in smaller packages, tend to be distributed around the world, and tend to be difficult to find and each involve unique circumstances. As such, it�s been difficult for larger companies to create a system for scooping up low cost electricity worldwide. Instead, the cheapest electricity and datacenters in the world tend to be held by smaller parties that don�t individually own all that much electricity or hashrate.  From what I�ve been able to dig up, the average professional mining farm is paying somewhere between 4 and 6 cents for electricity, and then another 3 to 6 cents for management and maintenance. A total cost of $50 per kilowatt per month is probably somewhere close to the median for large scale mining farms. As techniques improve and the industry grows, we expect this number to fall closer to $35 per kilowatt per month (including maintenance, land, taxes, etc.) throughout 2019 and 2020. We don�t believe that anyone paying more than $80 per kilowatt per month will be able to remain competitive unless the price of cryptocurrency continues to rise rapidly over the next year.  The top 20% of miners all seem to be below $35 per kilowatt per month already, from what we�ve been able to glean, and the top 5% seem to be below $20 per kilowatt per month. By my estimation, if the price of Bitcoin were to fall substantially, these mining operations would be able to stay in business and everyone paying $50 or more would be forced to shut down their facilities.  It�s really hard to know where Bitmain is at, but based on everything we�ve been seeing we estimate that Bitmain is somewhere around the $30 per kilowatt per month mark. That is, they are doing better than the median mining operation, but by no means are they in the elite tier.    The Chip is not Important  Most mining startups seem incredibly focused around the chip itself. From what we�ve seen, the chip is really less than half the story. So, the chip is important (apologies for the title), but if all you�ve got is the best chip in the world, you aren�t going to be a competitive manufacturer.  As a miner, the goal at the end of the day is to do as many hashes as possible for as little money as possible. A faster chip means that you need to spend less money on chips to get hashrate. And a more energy efficient chip means you need to spend less money on electricity to get hashrate. But you aren�t just spending money on chips and electricity. You spend money on PCB, on controllers, on ports like ethernet ports, on power supplies and power management, on fans, on enclosures, on shelves in your datacenter, etc.  At the end of the day the chip is only a portion of the equation for mining successfully. If you aren�t thinking about the whole picture, you are going to end up with a chip that will lose you money. This is actually one of the things that killed Butterfly Labs (among many) � they designed a high performance chip that produced hundreds of watts of heat. By comparison, Bitmain chips are typically about six watts each. Where Bitmain is able to throw on a forest of fat heatsinks, Butterfly Labs had to struggle with expensive, cutting edge, unreliable cooling systems, and that ultimately meant their powerhouse chip was late to market and too expensive to operate.  Bitmain is Impressive  People tend to under-estimate Bitmain. Yes, they have the most money, and yes, they dominate because of their economies of scale. But they also dominate because they�ve got the fastest to-market time of any company. They dominate because they�ve got the best chip developers in cryptocurrency. They dominate because they�ve innovated in dozens of places to squeeze costs and inefficiencies out of corners that most people aren�t aware exist. They hire the best people and pay them well. And they work hard to make sure that at every iteration, they are the ones on top.  There�s not a whole lot more to say here. I feel that a lot of people under-estimate Bitmain or assume that because they play dirty they wouldn�t be able to keep up without playing dirty. But that�s not true. They play dirty because it�s yet another place they can optimize their business, and because they know they can get away with it. Everything else they do is highly optimized as well. If we want to understand mining, we need to appreciate that the entity that controls most of mining today is an impressive, highly skilled, well refined entity.    Conclusion  The biggest takeaway from all of this is that mining is for big players. The more money you spend, the more of an advantage you have, and there�s not an easy way to change that equation. At least with traditional Nakamoto style consensus, a large entity that produces and controls most of the hashrate seems to be more or less the outcome, and at the very best you get into a situation where there are 2 or 3 major players that are all on similar footing. But I don�t think at any point in the next few decades will we see a situation where many manufacturing companies are all producing relatively competitive miners. Manufacturing just inherently leads to centralization, and it happens across many different vectors.  Though that�s discouraging news, it�s not the end of the world for Bitcoin or other Proof of Work based cryptocurrencies. Decentralization of hashrate is a good-to-have, but there are a large number of other incentives and mechanisms at play that keep monopoly manufacturers in line. A great example of this is the Bitcoin / Segwit2x situation. More than 80% of the hashrate was openly in support of activating Segwit2x, and yet the motion as a whole failed.  There are plenty of other tools available to cryptocurrency developers and communities as well to deal with a hostile hashrate base, including hardforks and community splits. The hashrate owners know this, and as a result they are careful not to do anything that would cause a revolt or threaten their healthy profit streams. And now that we know to expect a largely centralized hashrate, we can continue as developers and inventors to work on structures and schemes which are secure even when the hashrate is all pooled into a small number of places.

       " 'There�s one incredible feature of cryptocurrencies that almost everyone seems to have missed, including Satoshi himself.  But it�s there, hidden away, steadily gathering power like a hurricane far out to sea that�s sweeping towards the shore.  It�s a stealth feature, one that hasn�t activated yet.  But when it does it will ripple across the entire world, remaking every aspect of society.  To understand why, you just have to understand a little about the history of money.  The Ascent of Money  Money is power.  Nobody knew this better than the kings of the ancient world. That�s why they gave themselves an absolute monopoly on minting moolah.  They turned shiny metal into coins, paid their soldiers and their soldiers bought things at local stores. The king then sent their soldiers to the merchants with a simple message:  �Pay your taxes in this coin or we�ll kill you.�    That�s almost the entire history of money in one paragraph. Coercion and control of the supply with violence, aka the �violence hack.� The one hack to rule them all.  When power passed from monarchs to nation-states, distributing power from one strongman to a small group of strongmen, the power to print money passed to the state. Anyone who tried to create their own money got crushed.  The reason is simple:  Centralized enemies are easy to destroy with a �decapitation attack.� Cut off the head of the snake and that�s the end of anyone who would dare challenge the power of the state and its divine right to create coins.  That�s what happened to e-gold in 2008, one of the first attempts to create an alternative currency. Launched in 1996, by 2004 it had over a million accounts and at its peak in 2008 it was processing over $2 billion dollars worth of transactions.  The US government attacked the four leaders of the system, bringing charges against them for money laundering and running an �unlicensed money transmitting� business in the case �UNITED STATES of America v. E-GOLD, LTD, et al.� It destroyed the company by bankrupting the founders. Even with light sentences for the ring leaders, it was game over. Although the government didn�t technically shut down e-gold, practically it was finished. �Unlicensed� is the key word in their attack.  The power to grant a license is monopoly power.  E-gold was free to apply for interstate money transmitting licenses.  It�s just they were never going to get them.  And of course that put them out of business. It�s a living, breathing Catch-22. And it works every time.  Kings and nation states know the real golden rule:  Control the money and you control the world.  And so it�s gone for thousands and thousands of years. The very first emperor of China, Qin Shi Huang (260�210 BC), abolished all other forms of local currency and introduced a uniform copper coin. That�s been the blueprint ever since. Eradicate alternative coins, create one coin to rule them all and use brutality and blood to keep that power at all costs.  In the end, every system is vulnerable to violence.  Well, almost every one.  The Hydra  In decentralized systems, there is no head of the snake. Decentralized systems are a hydra. Cut off one head and two more pop-in to take its place.    In 2008, an anonymous programmer, working in secret, figured out the solution to the violence hack once and for all when he wrote: �Governments are good at cutting off the heads of centrally controlled networks like Napster, but pure P2P networks like Gnutella and Tor seem to be holding their own.�  And the first decentralized system of money was born:  Bitcoin.  It was explicitly designed to resist coercion and control by centralized powers.  Satoshi wisely remained anonymous for that very reason. He knew they would come after him because he was the symbolic head of Bitcoin.  That�s what�s happened every time someone has come forward claiming to be Satoshi or when someone has been �outed� by the news media as Bitcoin�s mysterious creator. When fake Satoshi Craig Wright came out, Australian authorities immediately raided his house. The official reason is always spurious. The real reason is to cut off the head of the snake.  As Bitcoin rises in value, the hunt for Satoshi will only intensify. He controls at least a million coins that have never moved from his original wallets. If VC Chris Dixon is right and Bitcoin rocket to $100,000 a coin, those million coins will shoot up to $100 billion. If it goes even higher, say a $1 million a coin, that would make him the world�s first trillionaire. And that will only bring the hammer down harder and faster on him. You can be 100% sure that black ops units would be gunning for him around the clock.  Wherever he is, my advice to Satoshi is this:  Stay anonymous until your death bed.  But resistance to censorship and violence are only one of a number of incredible features of Bitcoin. Many of those key components are already at work in a number of other cryptocurrencies and decentralized app projects, most notably blockchains.  Blockchains are distributed ledgers, the third entry in the world�s first triple-entry accounting system. And breakthroughs in accounting have always presaged a massive uptick in human complexity and economic growth, as I laid out in my article Why Everyone Missed the Most Important Invention in the Last 500 Years.  But even triple-entry accounting, decentralization and resistance to the violence hack are not the true power of cryptocurrencies. Those are merely the mechanisms of the system, the way it survives and thrives, bringing new capabilities to the human race.  The ultimate feature is one that Bitcoin and current cryptocurrencies have only hinted at so far, a latent feature.  The true power of cryptocurrencies is the power to print and distribute money without a central power.  Maybe that seems obvious, but I assure you, it�s not. Especially the second part.  That power has always rested with the divine right of kings and nation-states.  Until now.  Now that right returns to its rightful owners: The people.  And that will blow open the doors of world commerce, sowing the seeds for Star Trek like abundance economics, leaving the Old World Order of pure scarcity economics in the pages of history books.  There�s just one problem.  Nobody has created the cryptocurrency we actually need just yet.  You see, Satoshi understood the first part of the maxim, the power to print money. What he missed was the power to distribute that money.  The second part is actually the most crucial part of the puzzle. Missing it created a critical flaw in the Bitcoin ecosystem. Instead of distributing the money far and wide, it traded central bankers for an un-elected group of miners.  These miners play havoc with the system, holding back much needed software upgrades like SegWit for years and threatening pointless hard forks in order to drive down the price with FUD and scoop up more coins at a depressed price.  But what if there was a different way?  What if you could design a system that would completely alter the economic landscape of the world forever?  The key is how you distribute the money at the moment of creation.  And the first group to recognize this opportunity and put it into action will change the world.  To understand why you have to look at how money is created and pushed out into the system today.  The Great Pyramid  Today, money starts at the top and flows down to everyone else. Think of it as a pyramid.    In fact, we have a famous pyramid, with a third eye, on the dollar itself.  One of the most cliched arguments against Bitcoin is that it�s a Ponzi or �pyramid� scheme. A pyramid scheme rests on the original creators of the system roping in as many suckers as possible, paying them for enrolling people in the system rather than by offering goods and services. Eventually you run out of people to bring in and the whole things collapses like a house of cards. A Ponzi scheme is basically the same, in that you dupe the original investors with fake returns on their initial investment, a la Bernie Madoff, and then get them to rope in more suckers because they�re so elated by the huge returns.    The irony of course is that fiat currency, i.e. government printed money like the Yen or US dollar, is closer to a pyramid scheme than Bitcoin. Why? Because fiat money is minted at the top of the pyramid by central banks and then �trickled down� to everyone else.  The only problem is, it doesn�t trickle down all that well.  It moves out to a few big banks, who either lend it to people or give it to people for their labor. In fact, having a job or getting a loan are the primary methods that people at the bottom of the pyramid get any of the money. In other words, they trade their current time (with a job) or their future time (with a loan) for that money. It�s just that their time is a limited resource and they can only trade so much of it before it runs out.  Think of economics as a game. Everyone in the system is a player, looking to maximize their advantage and the advantage of their team (a company, their family and friends, etc.) to get more of the money. But to start the game you need to initially distribute the money or nobody can play. Distributing money sets the playing field.  Now if you were in charge of the money, how would you distribute it to the network? You�d want to keep as much of it for yourself as possible, so you�d set the rules to maximize your own personal advantage. Of course you would! That�s what anyone in their right mind would do, maximize their own power to keep it for as long as possible.    That�s precisely what the kings and queens of the ancient world did, and that�s what nation states do today. As Naval Ravikant said in his epic series of tweets on blockchain, today�s networks are run by �kings, corporations, aristocracies, and mobs.� �And the Rulers of these networks [are] the most powerful people in society.�  That�s why every single system in the history of the world has distributed the money in one way:  From the top down.  Because it maximizes the advantage of the kings and mobs at the top.  Unfortunately, that means most of the money never really leaves the top. It stays right there, as wasted and frozen potential that�s never realized. There is little to no incentive for the money to move. Since money is power, hoarding it is literally hoarding more power and nobody would willingly give up that power.  In other words, the game is rigged.  What we need is a way to reset the game.  Up until now, our prospects looked very dim.  For example, we could pass a law, like a Universal Basic Income (UBI). That would give everyone a stream of money, pushing it out across the entire playing field and giving more people a chance to participate in the system. If more people can participate, we unlock all kinds of hidden and untapped value.  How many great inventors never managed to create their next breakthrough because they were stuck driving a bus seven days a week to feed their family, with no hope of free time or any clear path to digging themselves out of debt? How many great writers went to their graves never having written their great novel? How many budding scientists never discovered the cure to cancer or heart disease?  The problem with all of the plans before now, from UBI to socialism (high taxes on the rich to spread the wealth across the game) is that to redistribute the money after it�s already been distributed is nearly impossible. The people with that money rightfully resist its redistribution. And as Margret Thatcher said �The trouble with Socialism is that eventually you run out of other people�s money.�  But what if the money is NOT already distributed?  What if we don�t have to take it from anyone at all?    The inevitable outcome of all fractional reserve lending booms is bust.  That�s the missed opportunity of all of today�s cryptocurrencies. Cryptocurrencies are creating new money. And unlike credit markets, which only pretend to expand the money supply, by lending it out 10x with fractional reserve lending, cryptocurrencies are literally printing money. And they aren�t loaning it to people, they�re giving it to them for their service to the network.  It�s like microloans, without the loans.  As Naval said: �Society gives you money for giving society what it wants, blockchains give you coins for giving the network what it wants.�  So instead of giving all the money to a small group of miners, what if we could do better? A lot better?  We can.  I outlined one way in the an article about the Cicada project, How We Deliver a Universal Basic Income Right Now and Save Ourselves from the Robots. The Cicada design flips the idea of mining on its head. Everyone on the network is a miner and nobody can have more than one miner.  Miners are drafted randomly to keep the network running smoothly. You might be walking along, getting coffee and your phone gets called on to secure the network for a few minutes. After that it goes right back to sleep. As a reward, you might win new coins for doing nothing but having the application on your phone. Simple right?  Because everyone is eventually drafted, everyone gets paid, in essence creating a UBI right now.  And that�s just one way.  If you think about it you can come up with dozens. Oh and don�t get caught up with thinking the only way to do this is with an ID. Lots of ways to randomly draft miners without that too. The key is to free your mind of the �Satoshi box� and think different.  What we really need is to completely gamify the delivery of money, distributing it far and wide at the moment of creation.    Money is a Game. Embrace it.  Give it out as rewards for using apps, or as distributed mining fees, or as shared cuts of the mining fees to organizations that provide value to the network are just a few more ways to do it right. Those are just the tip of the iceberg. There are thousands of ways but we just haven�t been thinking about the problem the right way.  In other words, we missed the real power of Satoshi�s creation: the distribution of money.  The first system that truly gamifies the delivery of money will rocket to exponential growth, upending the current system for good. That will set the initial playing field dynamically and allow players who never would have gotten into the game to compete. The more people who can participate, the more efficient and valuable the network becomes.  �Networks have �network effects.� Adding a new participant increases the value of the network for all existing participants.�  Right now, we�re not adding new participants fast enough to the cryptonets of tomorrow. The system is still vulnerable to the violence hack. Gamified money is the answer to exponential growth.  If the system can grow large enough, fast enough, it will become an unstoppable juggernaut, and the rest of the economic universe will need to come over to the new playing field.  Once the Amazons and Google�s of the world join the playing field, their self-preservation instinct will kick in and they�ll want to protect and expand it. And this new network will behave differently. Instead of rewarding just the people at the top, who�ve been rigging the rules in their favor since the beginning of time, the game will completely reset with a new set of rules.  What�s best for the whole network, not just the few players at the top, is best.  �Blockchains are a new invention that allows meritorious participants in an open network to govern without a ruler and without money. They are merit-based, tamper-proof, open, voting systems. The meritorious are those who work to advance the network. Blockchains� open and merit based markets can replace networks previously run by kings, corporations, aristocracies, and mobs.�  Those that join the network and help it grow will thrive and flourish with it. It will amplify their own value, making it grow faster than at any point in history. Every ounce they give to the system will magnify their own rewards.  By contrast, economies that stand against the network, attempting to cripple it with arbitrary rules, will pay a heavy price. The system will stretch across the globe and only the most essential rules will take root, because in order to upgrade a distributed system, you need vast consensus across the network. Since people can generally only agree on big, essential solutions, no self-defeating, narrow-minded rules will be allowed.  Let�s say that a country decides to restrict ICOs to their citizens altogether or make cryptocurrencies illegal. Instead of killing the network, the rules will blow back on their creators. Only their own people will suffer, as they won�t be able to participate in the explosion of new potential that ICOs bring to the table, draining money out of the economy into rival economies. Even worse, if they make cryptos illegal, they�ll simply drive that money underground, which will keep them from getting tax from their citizens, which will starve them of revenue.  As the system spreads it will put people back in control of their own financial power. No one will be able to take your money from you. And that is a good thing.    Of course, not everyone thinks so. Some folks always worry that people will do bad things with this power, like commit crimes. But people will always do bad things. They do those things now and they always have. Crippling the system for everyone just to get those people is the height of insanity. It has never worked and it never will.  Still, some people will never believe that.  They trust their central powers unquestioningly. All you have to do is wrap up your argument in �protecting the children� or �fighting terrorism� and you can generally fool half of the people half of the time about any terrible policy you want.  Yet I�ve found that people who see central systems as the answer to everything have usually lived in a stable central system for their whole lives.  A few days in an unstable system would change their minds very quickly.  Don�t believe me?  Imagine you lived in Syria right now.  Your central infrastructure is destroyed, as is your money. You don�t want the war, but there�s nothing you can do about it. Now your house is gone, your friends and family are dead, your banks are bombed out and you�re cast out, adrift, homeless and penniless. Even worse, nobody wants you. The world has shifted from open borders to building walls everywhere. You�re not welcome anywhere, you can�t stay where you are and you�re broke.  But what if your money was still there, recorded on the blockchain, waiting for you to download and restore a deterministic wallet and give it the right passphrase to restore it?  How much easier would it be to start your life over?  Cryptocurrencies finally offer a way for us to control our own destiny. For the very first time in the history of the world, we have a way to generate and distribute money without a central power. People will have control over the money they rightfully earned.  And even better, instead of setting the playing field so the game is always rigged, we can set the game up the way it was always meant to be played, with open competition and flexible rules in a dynamic system that allows everyone to compete.  But we need to think big. We need to find a way to distribute the money far and wide without taking it from everyone else. Do that and we change the game forever.  That�s what my team is working on.

       "['from the time the first website was published in 1991 until today the internet has profoundly reshaped humanity  comparisons between cryptocurrencies and the growth of the internet are invariably drawn including cryptocurrencies  netscape moment however i wanted to test this comparison and see exactly how far along we are  in this post i ll also be exploring the growth of the cryptocurrency market  the early growth of the internet to see what takeaways we can uncover  what makes this comparison tough  it s impossible to know exactly how many people use cryptocurrency and how often because   for people who self custodial their cryptocurrencies   people can have multiple wallets for different cryptocurrencies   for people who store their cryptocurrencies on exchanges   1 wallet address does not equate to 1 user on the exchange it s also typical for exchanges to create a wallet address for each transaction  thus the only way to get an understanding of the number of users for cryptocurrencies is through approximations  measuring cryptocurrency user growth  i tried to approximate cryptocurrency user growth in a few ways   bitcoin  ethereum wallet growth   bitcoin  ethereum active addresses growth proxy for dau   user growth of cryptofiat and cryptocrypto exchanges   total cryptocurrency trading volume over time    there are 24m bitcoin wallet addresses in total this doesn t mean there are 24m bitcoin users because one person can have more than 1 wallet address and it is recommended to generate a new bitcoin address for each transaction sent  i would consider 24m the upper bound number on the number of bitcoin users worldwide  in addition to looking at the number of wallets we can look at the number of active addresses per day to smooth out this chart i took a median value of active addresses by month and plotted it on a log scale    the highest amount of active addresses we ve seen per day was 11m addresses   this is an approximation of daily active users dau within the bitcoin network however if the main point of bitcoin is viewed as purely a store of value then you would assume a much lower dau vs any traditional mobile application or website  we can also do the same analysis for ethereum here is the ethereum address growth and active addresses per day in log scale      in total there are 31m ethereum addresses with peak daily active addresses on the ethereum network reaching 11m  ethereum is a bit different than bitcoin because smart contracts have their own addresses and usage on ethereum should naturally be higher since ethereum is designed as a smart contract platform not as a pure store of value  users of bitcoin and users of ethereum are not mutually exclusive as well i would assume a high degree of correlation between the two cryptocurrencies  another method to approximate the user growth of cryptocurrencies is to instead look at the exchanges themselves   both fiatcrypto and cryptocrypto exchanges  only a handful of crypto exchanges have published their total user stats  user growth statistics here is what i could find    if we take all of the exchanges trading with fees here is a breakdown of the market share by all of the crypto exchanges including fiat and cryptocrypto    furthermore if we take all of the exchanges where we know the user counts and trading volume we can come up with an estimated trading volume per user through this number we can forecast across all trading volume what the estimated users of cryptocurrencies as a whole are 202m users  i would consider this the lower bound on the number of cryptocurrency users based on the number of people who are trading  purchasing cryptocurrencies across all of the various exchanges  furthermore we can also look at the overall trading volume of all cryptocurrencies over time to see how trading volume have been trending from 2014 18 the chart below is also in log scale and the values have been averaged out per month to get a better sense of the overall trend line    while all of these measurements are not exact counts of users i would approximate the total users of cryptocurrencies to be between 20m30m people in total worldwide  comparing the growth of cryptocurrency users to the growth of internet users  now that we have an estimate on the total number of cryptocurrency users worldwide we can look at the growth of the internet and estimate how early we are in this trajectory  here is the growth of internet users    if we zoom into 1990 1995 for the internet compared to 2013 2018 in cryptocurrencies    you can see we re actually tracking quite closely with the early days of the internet if you think cryptocurrencies is going to follow a similar trajectory as the internet we look like we re in about year 1994 compared to the internet  we can also do a similar analysis comparing the number of websites in the early internet to the number of crypto projects in the space   for this i m taking the total number of cryptocurrencies  tokens  all of the dapps here is the growth trajectory of the number of websites    if we zoom into 1991 1995 in the growth of websites compared to 2014 17 in the growth of crypto assets tokens which received funding dapps    we are at year 1994 on this comparison as well for one last comparison we can look at the total number of internet companies which received funding from 2014 to 2017 compared to the number of internet startups that got funding from 1991 to 1995  funding amounts are adjusted for inflation and only account for internetsoftware company financings    my takeaways   even though we ve seen a huge increase for number of users of cryptocurrencies tokens and dapps   we are still in year 1994 if we compare the trajectory to the growth of the internet   however depending on your longterm view of the coreuse cases of blockchains  cryptocurrencies the analogy is either an apt analogy or a pointless endeavor   if you view the core usecases of cryptocurrencies as a new asset class then i wouldn t necessarily expect cryptocurrencies to follow the same trajectory as the internet   both in terms of user growth  growth of assets equivalent to websites on the internet   if you view the core usecases of cryptocurrencies as an application platform for decentralized applications dapps   or better known as the decentralized internet   then the growth of users  dapps would be comparable to the growth of internet users  website growth  my biggest criticism towards the dapp future is we haven t seen dapp usage keep pace with the number of dapps being created the current core use cases of cryptocurrencies are speculation store of value assets payments etc  looking at the data we can see the use case of cryptocurrencies as an asset class has considerably more proof points and measurable user adoption however the future of decentralized applications while interesting to track is still too early to measure  a big thank you to ricky tan

       " 'ever since nas daily s video came out about how i earned over 400000 with less than 10000 investing in bitcoin and ethereum i ve been getting hundreds of questions from people around the world about how to get started with cryptocurrency investment  first i m super glad there s so much interest in cryptocurrency right now i firmly do believe that cryptocurrency and blockchain technology has the potential to fundamentally change much of the way our world currently operates for the better it reminds me a lot of the internet in the 90s  second investment in cryptocurrency isn t something to be taken lightly it s extremely risky extremely speculative and extremely early stage still at this point in time countless speculators and day traders have lost their entire fortunes trading cryptocurrency i was no different when i first started investing in crypto the first 5000 i put into crypto fell almost immediately to less than 500   a net loss of over 90  third all of the following words are entirely and solely my own opinion and do not reflect any objective truth in the world or the opinions or perspective of any other individual or entity i write them here merely so people can know how i personally approach cryptocurrency and what i have personally found helpful in my foray into this realm  i m firmly of the opinion that one should never invest in something one doesn t thoroughly understand so i m going to split this article into three parts  the first part will speak to a broad explanation of what bitcoin and cryptocurrency at large are the second will discuss my personal investment philosophy as it pertains to crypto the third will show you step by step how to actually begin investing in crypto if you so choose each section will be clearly delineated so feel free to skip parts if they re already familiar to you  part i what is bitcoin why is it useful  great question if you want the full story behind the advent of bitcoin i highly recommend the book digital gold it traces the entire history of bitcoin from its inception all the way up to 2015 it s an engrossing read and highly informative  for now let s start with a quick history lesson about bitcoin bitcoin was officially unveiled to the public in a white paper published october 31st 2008 the white paper is actually extremely readable very short just 8 pages and incredibly elegantly written if you want to understand why bitcoin is so compelling straight from the horse s mouth you must read this paper it will explain everything better than i or anyone else likely ever could  i won t delve too much into the technical details of how bitcoin works which are better elucidated in the white paper but will instead focus on a broader exploration of its history and implications  subpart the background context of bitcoin  bitcoin was invented in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis and the crisis was a clear motivating factor for its creation  numerous banks and other financial institutions failed across the world and had to be bailed out by governments at the expense of their taxpayers this underscored the fragility of the modern financial system where the health of our monetary system is reliant on banks and other financial institutions that we are forced to trust to make wise and prudent decisions with the money we give them too often for comfort they fail to carry out this fiduciary responsibility to an adequate degree  of particular note is fractional reserve banking when you give a bank 1000 the bank doesn t actually keep all that money for you it goes out and is legally allowed to spend up to 900 of your money and keep just 100 in the off chance that you ask for your money back  in the most simplistic case if you are the only depositor at this bank and you ask for more than 100 back at once the bank won t be able to give you your money because it doesn t have it any more  shockingly this is actually how banks work in reality in the united states the reserve requirement or the percentage of net deposits banks are actually required to keep in liquid financial instruments on hand is generally 10 for most banks this means that if a bank has net deposits of a billion dollars it needs to only keep 100 million on hand at any given time  this is fine most of the time as generally the customers of that bank won t all try to cash out at the same time and the bank is able to stay liquid however the moment customers start to question the bank s financial stability things can go south very quickly if just a small number of customers begin asking for all their deposits back a bank can rapidly become depleted of all its liquid funds  this leads to what s known as a bank run where the bank fails because it is unable to fulfill all the withdrawals customers demand this can escalate quickly into a systemic bank panic where multiple banks begin to suffer the same fate each successive failure compounds the collective panic and quite quickly the whole system can begin to collapse like a house of cards  this is what led in large part to the great depression for instance the whole system is fundamentally predicated on trust in the system and the second that vanishes everything can go south incredibly quickly  the financial crisis of 2008 highlighted yet another risk of the modern banking system when a bank goes out and spends the 90 of net deposits it holds in investments it can often make very bad bets and lose all that money in the case of the 2008 crisis banks in particular bet on high risk subprime mortgages these were mortgages taken out by borrowers very likely to become delinquent to purchase houses that were sharply inflated in value by the rampant ease of acquiring a mortgage  when those mortgages were defaulted on the artificially inflated values of the homes began to collapse and banks were left holding assets worth far less than the amount they had lent out as a consequence they now had nowhere near the amount of money that customers had given them and began experiencing liquidity crises that led to their ultimate bankruptcy and demise  after the great depression occurred the government attempted to address this issue by creating the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic which technically guarantees all customer deposits in participating banks up to 250000 per account  unfortunately the fdic is just as dramatically underfunded as banks are as the fdic itself acknowledges it holds enough money to cover just over 1 of all the deposits it insures in other words if banks reneged on any more than 1 of all their deposits the fdic itself would also fail and everyone would yet again be left in the dust without recourse  in fact this has already happened the fdic used to have a sister corporation that insured savings and loan institutions as it itself at the time only insured bank deposits and not savings and loan institution deposits this was known as the federal savings and loan insurance corporation or fslic  in the savings and loan crisis of the 1980s over 1000 of the 3200 savings and loan institutions in the united states failed in rapid succession the fslic almost immediately became insolvent itself and had to be recapitalized several times with over 25 billion dollars of taxpayer money even this didn t even come close to being sufficient to solve the crisis and the fslic managed to only resolve the failure of less than 300 of the 1000 bankrupt institutions even with all the handouts from taxpayers before it just flat out gave up and dissolved itself  for the most part things generally work fine on a day to day basis this belies however the true fragility of the system it s hard to anticipate these things before they happen because it s so easy to fall into the trap of assuming that things will always be as they mostly always have been if things have been fine yesterday and the day before and the few years before that or even the few decades before that we just naturally assume that they will continue to be fine for the indefinite future  history has proven this to be an often fatal assumptive error the second things start to stop working they tend to stop working in an extremely rapid catastrophic fashion there s very little if anything stopping us from seeing another great depression sometime in the future be it the near or longer term future when that does happen   and it almost certainly will sooner or later if history is any good teacher   those who haven t adequately prepared for it and taken appropriate prophylactic measures may very well find themselves in a bad spot  subpart fiat currencies compound the dilemma  mistrust in fiat currencies or currencies created and backed solely by faith in a government both because of the modern banking system and because of the inherent nature of fiat currency has in large part been why gold has been used as such a reliable store of value over millennia  fiat currencies are the world s predominant form of currency today the us dollar or the british pound for instance are fiat currencies these are currencies that are entirely controlled in their supply and creation by a national government and are backed by nothing but faith in that government  this has proved a mistake countless times throughout history zimbabwe is a classic example where the zimbabwean dollar thanks to an incompetent government among other factors experienced enormous levels of hyperinflation at one point inflation was estimated at almost 80 billion percent in just a single monththe following image gives an idea of just how rapidly and absurdly a fiat currency can spiral out of control once it reaches the point of no return    lest we think this an isolated instance venezuela is experiencing incredibly similar hyperinflation in the presentday right this moment the venezuelan bolvar inflated over 800 in 2016 and shows no signs of stopping in 2017  the us hasn t been immune to these crises either the us began its foray into fiat currency with the issuance of continental currency in 1775 just three years later continental currency was worth less than 20 of its original value 13 years later hyperinflation entirely collapsed the currency and the us had to pass a law guaranteeing that all future currencies would be backed by gold and silver and that no unbacked currencies could be issued by any state  in comparison the early history of the us dollar makes the relative volatility of bitcoin in these first 9 years look like peanuts  once adopted out of necessity the gold standard became part and parcel of us currency just as it was with most other currencies from around the world the gold standard removed some of the need to have pure faith in us dollars in of themselves as it guaranteed that all paper money the us issued would be exchangeable at a fixed rate for gold upon demand  naturally you still had to believe that the government would actually keep enough gold to fulfill all these demands dj vu and foreshadowing anyone any flashbacks to fractional reserve banking yet but it was certainly better than nothing  gold unlike fiat currencies requires no trust and faith in a government to responsibly manage its money supply and other financial dealings in order to believe that it will retain its value well over time this is because gold has no central authority that controls it and effectively dictates its supply and creation arbitrarily gold is fundamentally scarce and only a small amount of it can be mined every year and added to the whole net supply to date the estimated total of all the gold ever mined in the history of humankind is only 165000 metric tons to put that in perspective all that gold wouldn t even fill up 35 olympic sized swimming pools  no government no matter how much they wanted to or needed to could simply conjure up more gold on demand fiat currencies on the other hand can and often have been printed on demand by governments whenever they happened to be short on cash and needed a quick infusion  this printing of more money generally leads to inflation as the total value of all the money in existence rationally should stay the same no matter how many dollars are printed hence if more dollars are printed each dollar is worth fractionally less of the total money supply  in fact governments design their currencies and monetary policies to inflate intentionally this is why 100 us dollars in 1913 when the government officially started tracking inflation rates is equivalent to 2470 dollars today just over 100 years later  in fact the average inflation rate of the us dollar over that time period was about 322 this seems low but in reality means that prices double just every twenty years in other words your money becomes half as valuable if you keep it in us dollars every twenty years doesn t seem ultra cool to me  gold on the other hand doesn t inflate like fiat currencies do that s because there s an intrinsically limited supply and consequently things tend to cost the same in gold over long periods of time in fact 2000 years ago roman centurions were paid about 3858 ounces of gold in us dollars today this comes out to about 48350 the base salary of a captain in the us army today comes out to just about the same at 48500  this makes gold in many ways a better store of value based on fundamental principles than fiat currencies over time you don t have to trust anyone to trust that your gold will retain its value relatively well across the sands of time  unfortunately the gold standard collapsed multiple times during the 20th century and was ultimately abandoned altogether by almost every nation in the world because governments effectively played fractional reserve banking with their gold reserves who could blame them it must be irresistibly tempting knowing that in all likelihood the vast majority of the time only a fraction of people will ever want to trade in their dollars for gold why hold all that gold when you could hold just a fraction of it and get to spend the rest with no consequences in the short term  inevitably this caught up with each and every government over time for the united states the gold standard was suspended in the aftermath of the great depression the bretton woods international agreement instituted in the aftermath of world war ii restored the gold standard to the us dollar but this was short lived  under the bretton woods system numerous foreign governments held us dollars as an indirect and more convenient method of holding gold as us dollars were supposedly directly exchangeable at a fixed rate for gold however by 1966 gold reserves actually held by the us were already pitifully low with only 132 billion worth of gold being held by the government  by 1971 other governments had caught on to this and began demanding the exchange of all their us dollars for gold as was promised to them naturally the us had nowhere near enough gold to fulfill their promises and this became a government version of the bank run essentially  the us chose instead to fully renege on their promised exchange rate and announced in what was known as the nixon shock that the us dollar would no longer be redeemable for gold and would henceforth be backed solely by faith in the us government very faithinspiring no  almost every nation quickly followed suit and since then fiat currencies have been allowed free reign to grow as they please with no accountability whatsoever in how much a government chooses to expand their money supply  this thus requires anyone holding fiat currencies to have extreme trust that their government will manage their money supply responsibly and not make poor financial decisions that will severely devalue the currency they hold this compounds with the trust one must hold in the banks in which one deposits their fiat currency to create an ultimate monetary system that has multiple points of very real possible failure as history has shown time and again  holding gold privately removes the need to trust either of these points of failure in the modern banking system but comes with its own host of problems namely while gold has proven to be an excellent store of value over time it is incredibly poor for actual day to day use in the modern economy to transact with gold is excessively cumbersome and inconvenient no one would consider walking around with an ounce of gold on them measuring and shaving off exact portions of gold to pay for a cup of coffee groceries or a bus ride worse it s even more difficult and time consuming to send gold to anyone who isn t physically in the same exact location as you  for these reasons among others fiat currencies have traditionally been preferred for everyday use despite their many shortcomings and associated inherent risks  no solution to this tradeoff conundrum has heretofore been discovered or even necessarily possible bitcoin however with the aid of recent technological advances computers and the internet solves all of these issues it takes the best of both worlds and puts it into one beautiful elegant solution  subpart bitcoin to the rescue  holy longwindedness batman 2700 words later and we finally get to talking about bitcoin i m as relieved as you are remind me never to write again  bitcoin was designed essentially as a better  digital gold  it incorporates all of the best elements of gold   its inherent scarcity and decentralized nature   and then solves all the shortcomings of gold in allowing it to be globally transactable in precise denominations extremely quickly  how does it do this in short by emulating gold s production digitally gold is physically mined out of the ground bitcoin is also  mined  but digitally the production of bitcoin is controlled by code that dictates you must find a specific answer to a given problem in order to unlock new bitcoins  in technical terms bitcoin utilizes the same proofofwork system that hashcash devised in 1997 this system dictates that one must find an input that when hashed creates an output with a specific number of preceding zeros among a few other specific requirements  this is where the  crypto  incidentally in cryptocurrency comes from cryptographic hash functions are fundamentally necessary for the functioning of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as they are oneway functions oneway functions work such that it is easy to calculate an output given an input but near impossible to calculate the original input given the output hence cryptographic oneway hash functions enable bitcoin s proof of work system as it ensures that it is nighimpossible for someone to just see the output required to unlock new bitcoins and calculate in reverse the input that created that output  instead one must essentially bruteforce the solution by trying every single possible input in order to find one that creates an output that satisfies the specified requirements  bitcoin is further ingeniously devised to guarantee that on average new bitcoins are only found every 10 minutes or so it guarantees this by ensuring that the code that dictates the new creation of bitcoin automatically increases the difficulty of the proofofwork system in proportion to the number of computers trying to solve the problem at hand  for instance in the very beginning of time it was only the creator of bitcoin who was mining for bitcoins he used one computer to do so for simplicity s sake let s assume this one computer could try 1000 different values to hash a second in a minute it would hash 60000 values and in 10 minutes 600000 values  the algorithm that dictates the mining of bitcoins therefore would ensure that on average it would take 600000 random tries of hashing values to find one that would fulfill the requirements of the specified output required to unlock the next block of bitcoins  it can do this by making the problem more or less difficult by requiring more or less zeros at the beginning of the output that solves the problem the more zeros that are required at the beginning of the output the more exponentially difficult the problem becomes to solve to understand why this is click here for a reasonably good explanation  in this case it would require just the right amount of leading zeros and other characters to ensure that a solution is found on average every 600000 or so tries  however imagine now that a new computer joins the network and this one too can compute 1000 hashes a second this effectively doubles the rate at which the problem can be solved because now on average 600000 hashes are tried every 5 minutes not 10  bitcoin s code elegantly solves this problem by ensuring that every 2016 times new bitcoin is mined roughly every 14 days at 10 minutes per block the difficulty adjusts to become proportional to how much more or less hashing power is mining for bitcoin such that on average new bitcoin continues to be found roughly every ten minutes or so  you can see the present difficulty of mining bitcoin here it should be evident from a halfsecond glance that the amount of computing power working to mine bitcoin right now is immense and the difficulty is proportionally similarly immense as of the time of this writing right now there are close to 5 billion billion hashes per second being run to try to find the next block of bitcoin  this system holds a lot of advantages even over gold s natural system of being mined out of the ground gold s mining is effectively random and not dictated by any perfect computer algorithm and is consequently much more unpredictable in its output at any given moment if a huge supply of gold is serendipitously found somewhere it could theoretically dramatically inflate the rate at which gold enters the existing supply and consequently cause an unanticipated decrease in the unit price of gold  this isn t just theoretical   it s the reality of gold production this graph illustrates vividly the fact that gold production has been dramatically increasing over time and is today over four times higher than just a hundred years ago    in fact more than half of all the gold that has ever been mined in the history of humankind has been mined in just the past 50 years the difficulty of mining gold doesn t proportionally increase with the number of people mining it or with technological innovations that make it significantly easier to locate and mine gold over time  bitcoin on the other hand will always be mined on a carefully regulated schedule because it can perfectly adapt no matter how many people begin to mine it or how technologically advanced bitcoin mining hardware becomes  in fact it s already known for certain that there will only ever be a total of 21 million bitcoins in the world  this is because the amount of bitcoin that is mined every time a hash problem is solved and a new block is created halves every 210000 blocks or roughly every 4 years  the initial reward per block used to be 50 bitcoins back in 2009 after about four years this dropped to 25 bitcoins in late 2012 the last halving occurred in july 2016 and dropped the reward per block mined to 125 in 2020 this should go down to 625 in 2024 3125 and so forth all the way until the reward drops to essentially zero  when all is said and done there will hence be 21 million bitcoins exactly that no more no less elegant no this eliminates yet another risk with extant currencies gold included there are absolutely no surprises when it comes to knowing the present and future supply of bitcoin a million bitcoin will never be found randomly in california one day and incite a digital gold rush    the total supply of bitcoin over time look how straight the line is getting over time note halvings here too  on top of this bitcoin is trivially divisible to any arbitrary degree presently the smallest unit of bitcoin is known as a satoshi and is one hundred millionth of a single bitcoin 000000001 bitcoins  1 satoshi  this means that unlike gold bitcoin is perfectly suited to not only being an inflationproof store of value but also a daytoday transactable currency as well as it is easily divisible to any arbitrary amount you can buy a cup of coffee with it just as easily as you can buy a car  moreover bitcoin can be sent incredibly quickly and remotely over the internet to anyone anywhere in the world this is because when bitcoin is mined the miners are actually providing a service in powering the bitcoin network  what happens when a miner mines bitcoin is actually that they add a  block  to what is known as the  blockchain  the blockchain is a ledger that contains a record of every transaction ever made with bitcoins since its inception when someone decides to mine bitcoin they must download the entire blockchain as it presently stands  then when they successfully find a solution to the next hash problem and mine a block of bitcoins something magical happens they get to add the block they just mined to the end of the existing blockchain   and with it they include every transaction that was initiated on the bitcoin network since the last block was mined they then propagate this block they just created to the rest of the network of bitcoin miners who all then update their own blockchains with this new block and begin working on solving the next hash problem  as a reward for providing this valuable service miners are allowed to add a single transaction to the beginning of the block they mined called the  coinbase transaction  this transaction contains the brand new bitcoin that was created when they mined the block and allows the miner to claim this bitcoin for themselves  at this point a particularly shrewd reader might become concerned with the fact that the reward for mining a new block of bitcoin gradually shrinks to zero won t this cause miners to stop mining bitcoin and consequently to stop providing the invaluable service that allows the bitcoin network to function and for transactions to be sent  the answer is no because miners are not solely rewarded by the new bitcoin that is generated each time they mine a block users may also send a transaction fee along with their transactions which is paid out to any miner who decides to include their transaction in a block they mine over time as the bitcoin network becomes used for more and more transactions it is expected that transaction fees will be more than sufficient for incentivizing enough miners to continue mining blocks to keep the bitcoin network safe secure and robust  it s important that enough miners keep trying to mine blocks because this is another valuable service miners provide the network bitcoin like gold is powerful as a store of value because it is decentralized and trustless there is no one central authority who holds all the power over bitcoin just like no central authority holds power over gold  no one person or government can decide to conjure up more bitcoin on demand or to take it away the only way the rules that govern bitcoin can be changed is if the software bitcoin miners run to mine bitcoin is changed  technically any bitcoin miner could decide to change the software they run to mine bitcoin at any time however this still doesn t have any impact on changing bitcoin itself what it would do is cause a  hard fork  or a divergence in the block chain  this occurs because any block that the rogue miner who changed their software mines won t be accepted by all the other miners who are still running the original software consequently all the other miners will begin mining different blocks and adding those to their blockchain this leads to a fork in the road essentially where two completely different blockchains are formed   one by the rogue miner and one by all the other miners  everything up to the point of the software change remains the same in both blockchains but after that change the blockchains diverge once diverged they can never be reconciled and remerged  this isn t a concern however because the bitcoin network runs on consensus and accepts whichever blockchain is the longest in practice this means that whichever blockchain has the most computing power behind it is effectively guaranteed to win as they ll be able to calculate the solutions to the hash problems and find new blocks faster than their less powerful competitors  this does mean that in theory bitcoin is vulnerable to what s known as a 51 attack   an attack in which if a single entity was able to gain control of at least 51 of the total hashing power being directed at bitcoin mining it could outpace a legitimate blockchain and temporarily take control of the network  this is an extraordinarily difficult feat to accomplish however as the more people there are mining bitcoin the harder it is to take over the network at the current worldwide mining rate of almost 5 billion gigahashes a second it would be extraordinarily difficult for even the most powerful organizations in the world eg largescale governments to mount a successful 51 attack it would be enormously costly and quite possibly more financially detrimental to the attacker than to the network  indeed the only thing a 51 attacker could really accomplish is destroying collective faith in bitcoin they couldn t somehow steal and gain all the value of bitcoins for itself the attacker wouldn t be able to generate new bitcoins on demand arbitrarily and would still have to mine for them they also would have no control over taking bitcoins created in the past that didn t belong to them the only thing they could do really is repeatedly spend bitcoin they already owned again and again but even this is limited in its value because  honest  miner nodes would never accept these fraudulent payments  hence no rationally selfinterested bitcoin miner would ever try to mount a 51 attack as in all likelihood they would lose massive amounts of money doing so and gain almost nothing from the effort the only reason someone would want to conduct a 51 attack is to attempt to destroy faith in bitcoin   large governments for instance who might one day feel that their fiat currencies that presently provide them great value to them are becoming threatened by bitcoin however the likelihood even of these enormous entities to successfully conduct a 51 attack is already becoming vanishingly small as mining power increases  thus bitcoin has perfectly utilized recent technological advances to create something heretofore impossible an extremely safe reliable decentralized and globally transactable digital and better version of gold and possibly of all types of extant currency at large  the advantages don t stop there however bitcoin is also  pseudonymous  meaning that while all transactions ever conducted on the network are public and known by all as everything is recorded in the blockchain unless someone knows who owns the bitcoins that are being used in these transactions there is no way to trace those bitcoins and transactions back to a given person or entity  this serves a dual purpose of both allowing extreme transparency when desired in making transactions and also allowing a lot of anonymity when desired if one wants to ensure that they have perfect undeniable proof of their transactions all they have to do is prove they own certain bitcoins and then any and all transactions conducted with those bitcoins are undeniably theirs and most certainly occurred  if one wants rather to keep the movement of their money less overt one simply needs to ensure that the bitcoins they own are never tied to their identities and that their transactions on the network are obfuscated this can be accomplished with a variety of methods such as using a tumbler which allows one to send bitcoins to an intermediary service that will mix these bitcoins with bitcoins from numerous other sources and then send bitcoins forward to the intended destination from sources entirely unrelated to the sender s original bitcoins  to clarify this a bit more bitcoins are stored at what are known as  addresses  think of this as an email address or a mailing address these addresses allow for the storage sending and receiving of bitcoin the blockchain ledger contains a complete record of the movement of bitcoins from one address to another  a tumbler allows someone who say wants to move bitcoins from address 10 to address 100 to instead move their bitcoins from address 10 to a totally random address say 57 in some other transaction the tumbler has accepted bitcoins from someone entirely unrelated at say address 20 who wanted to send the coins ultimately to 200 and sent these instead to another completely random address 42 it then sends the coins stored at address 42 from sender 2 to the address sender 1 originally desired 100 and sends the coins stored at address 57 from sender 1 to the address sender 2 desired 200  this is highly simplified but effectively how a tumbler works albeit at much larger scale and with many more senders and receivers of all sorts of varying amounts  this ability to transact more anonymously in a digital global fashion than ever before has indeed opened the gateway to some of bitcoin s more infamous use cases much illicit activity has been enabled by this pseudonymity of bitcoin including the sale of drugs and other illegal goods online a more recent development has also been ransomware whereby malware can now cut straight to the chase and lock up your computer and demand straight up money in the form of bitcoin in exchange for the release of your computer s data  these developments have been enabled not only by bitcoin s pseudonymity but also the irrevocability of transactions unlike current forms of digital payment such as credit cards and bank transfers bitcoin transactions are irreversible and do not involve any middleman who can mediate between disputes  this has its disadvantages but also its advantages and was indeed one of the primary benefits the creator of bitcoin a pseudonymous asofyet unidentified figure himself satoshi nakamoto outlined in the bitcoin white paper in his own words  commerce on the internet has come to rely almost exclusively on financial institutions serving as trusted third parties to process electronic payments while the system works well enough for most transactions it still suffers from the inherent weaknesses of the trust based model completely nonreversible transactions are not really possible since financial institutions cannot avoid mediating disputes  the cost of mediation increases transaction costs limiting the minimum practical transaction size and cutting off the possibility for small casual transactions and there is a broader cost in the loss of ability to make nonreversible payments for nonreversible services with the possibility of reversal the need for trust spreads  merchants must be wary of their customers hassling them for more information than they would otherwise need a certain percentage of fraud is accepted as unavoidable these costs and payment uncertainties can be avoided in person by using physical currency but no mechanism exists to make payments over a communications channel without a trusted party  what is needed is an electronic payment system based on cryptographic proof instead of trust allowing any two willing parties to transact directly with each other without the need for a trusted third party transactions that are computationally impractical to reverse would protect sellers from fraud and routine escrow mechanisms could easily be implemented to protect buyers  as satoshi notes bitcoin s irreversible trustless nature removes the need for any middlemen to mediate and broker the process of payments from one person to another middlemen eg banks and credit card networks inherently introduce overhead costs and inefficiency into the system which make transactions   and micropayments in particular   more costly than would otherwise be the case  fraud is also inherently eliminated as any transaction propagated and confirmed by the bitcoin network by 6 or more blocks is generally accepted to be impossible to ever revoke  trustlessness in this sense is a huge component and advantage of bitcoin and cryptocurrency at large another groundbreaking innovation the blockchain introduces is the concept of a smart contract or a contract that similarly requires no trust or middleman to mediate but is rather contractually executed in a deterministic fashion through code run on the blockchain  traditionally with a legal contract two parties agree to certain terms with the understanding that if one party reneges the other party can seek legal recourse with the governmental justice system lawsuits however can often be inordinately expensive and in many cases the outcome is far from certain a good or bad lawyer can make or break a case and one is also at the mercy of a judge andor jury and their subjective possibly mercurial whims not the most efficient or foolproof system  a contract written with and enforced by code however removes the need to trust a third party arbitrator such as a court system in much the same way that transactions enforced by bitcoin s code remove the need to trust a third party financial institution the code is written in such a way that clearly specifies the conditions of the contract and will automatically enforce these conditions  for instance if two parties decide to make a bet on donald trump winning the election historically this could only be done by either word of honor or by some ad hoc legal contract for a say small 100 bet it would be absolutely a nonstarter to pursue legal action in the case that one of the parties decided to renege on the deal in the aftermath of the election normally the renegedupon party would simply be left in the dust without recourse  with the advent of smart contracts made possible by the blockchain however this is soontobe a thing of the past one can create a simple smart contract at effectively almost no cost that specifies in code that each party will send it 100 in bitcoin and that upon the completion of the election process it will either send all 200 to the party that bet on donald trump winning the election or send the 200 to the party that bet on him losing the election no ifs ands or buts the code is clear objective and deterministic either the contract is fulfilled in one direction or it is fulfilled in the other no need to trust the other party in the bet at all much less a third party to mediate  ethereum as will be noted later hopefully in another article because my god i never want to write again takes this concept to the next level and runs with it  one further benefit to bitcoin is that it is truly yours to own and you can keep it yourself without the need for a bank or any other intermediary and use it just as easily as you might a credit card this ensures that you won t fall victim to a banking system collapse brought on by fractional reserve banking or irresponsible government and financial institution fiscal policies in general it also ensures however that no one can take your money from you even on an individual basis global financial apocalypse aside  this like systemic banking failures is not something most people generally have to worry about 99 of the time however in the 1 of cases where this does become an issue it becomes a very serious issue refugees and other victims of persecution and oppression are clear examples of this  as a refugee generally if you hope to escape with your money you have to carry it in physical form on you either in gold or in paper currency this is limiting for a few reasons one you can only take so much as you can carry or convert to physical form and two physical currencies are exceedingly simple to detect and confiscate  again while this all seems incredibly farfetched today for most people but not all as the present day european migrant crisis has made abundantly clear it happens much more often than one might expect a little remembered fact is that the united states itself once outlawed the possession of gold back in 1933 with executive order 6102 and forced all its citizens to relinquish all gold to the united states at a fixed price of 2067 per troy ounce  immediately thereafter the us treasury revalued all their gold at 35 per troy ounce for foreign transactions and in the process reaped an enormous profit at the expense of all the citizens that were forced to give up their gold at fire sale prices  it sounds incredible but this is real life the government threatened to fine anyone caught possessing gold in violation of this order 10000 185000 today and throw them in jail for up to ten years a famous case involved one frederick barber campbell who had on deposit at chase bank over 5000 ounces of gold worth over 6 million today and attempted to withdraw the gold that he rightfully owned chase refused to allow him to do so so he decided to sue chase for depriving him of his assets  in response to his lawsuit this case demonstrates the value of basically everything about bitcoin from the ability to store your own money to the ability to not rely on the legal system for recourse campbell was counterattacked and indicted by a federal prosecutor and had to defend himself in court for not giving up his gold  ultimately while campbell didn t end up going to jail the government did decide to seize all his gold and confiscated all 6 million worth of gold from him  it took a full 40 years or until 1974 before gerald ford signed a bill making it once again legal for private individuals and corporations to own gold within the united states  this underscores the oft mercurial whims of governments even wellregarded ones like that of the united states that most citizens heretofore have been subject to without relief or alternative most of the time things run well enough that we all get by without having to think about this fact too much sometimes however things do go really really wrong  bitcoin fundamentally changes this equation unlike even gold bitcoin is nigh impossible when stored correctly for anyone to confiscate without consent the addresses at which bitcoin values are stored are protected by  private keys  which can be thought of as a password or a key to a lockbox without this private key it is generally impossible to steal the bitcoins held at the public address to which the private key corresponds so long as you keep this private key secure your bitcoins are secure  with things like brain wallets possible this means that even in the worst case scenario you can literally store your bitcoins in your brain and nowhere else and thereby easily prevent their confiscation just yet another fundamental innovation in the evolution of currency that bitcoin has made possible   its fully intangible nature is actually an asset  the intangibility of bitcoin however does seem to hang some people up it s sometimes difficult to immediately conceive of how bitcoins could possibly hold value as these people contend when they are intrinsically worthless they are nothing but a concept backed up by some computer code gold is a physical tangible object that you can hold in your hand it has real uses in industry and as jewelry that lend it value even paper money can be used for kindling or toilet paper if the need necessitates  bitcoin on the other hand is fully intangible it is just a concept backed by code no more no less it can t be used for anything functional besides being transferred in concept to other people as a store of value how could something like this possibly hold value like other existing currencies  it s a good question and one that underscores just how interesting the concept of money really is and how rarely we actually think critically about it  sure let s say that you can t compare bitcoin to gold and say it s better because gold has tangible realworld utility and bitcoin doesn t  what is the value of that realworld utility only about 12 of gold purchased every year is actually used for industrial and medical purposes if this is truly where gold s value is derived from gold would be worth dramatically less than it actually is  to the other point gold s coveted status in jewelry is merely a derivative property of its perceived value which leads to its designation as a status symbol without that underlying perceived value it would command far less value in jewelry consequently the question still remains about the gap between the industrial and medical value of gold and the actual value of gold as determined by the market where does the value in that gap come from  this is even more true of paper currency yes you can utilize and reuse the paper for all the intrinsic value paper has but what is that intrinsic value of paper this is easy to answer because we can just see how much the government pays to make paper money 1 and 2 bills cost less than 5 cents to make on the low end of the spectrum while 100 bills cost 123 cents on the high end  even the 1 bill which seems to be the best deal if one is valuing the worth of one s currency based on its intrinsic  tangible  value has only 5 cents worth of actual paper value behind it or 5 of its actual denominated value where does the rest of that 95 cents of value come from  it turns out these gaps in value between the worth of the  tangible  thing itself and the actual value of the currency as it stands on the market today is just as much conjured up out of thin air as a mere concept as bitcoin s perceived value is  this  intangible  worth that we ascribe to currency which accounts for the vast majority of the value of all currencies not just bitcoin is ultimately what makes money work yuval noah harari captures this fact very well in sapiens where he lays out the case that the value of a given form of money is essentially an indication of trust in that form of money it is our shared collective trust and belief in a currency that gives it value not its intrinsic tangible utility or anything else  gold holds its value well because we trust that we will all collectively continue to trust it as a store of value forever predominantly due to its scarcity and lack of centralized control fiat currencies hold their value well when they do because people trust that everyone else trusts the currency as well and that it is deserving of trust the moment that collective trust collapses so too does the currency no matter what its intrinsic  tangible  value  this is why no fiat currency has ever stood the test of time over a long enough timescale whereas gold has to date always stood the test of time and retained its value well collective trust for gold has never collapsed because of its inherent scarcity and immunity to the vicissitudes fiat currencies must endure at the hands of capricious centralized governing powers whereas collective trust in every historical fiat currency has inevitably failed to date and collective trust in many presentday fiat currencies continues to fail as we speak  with this in mind bitcoin can arguably be seen as the purest form of money as its value is entirely predicated on trust in it and nothing else it can arguably also be seen as the most trustworthy of currencies as it was bespoke made by intentional design to exhibit all the best elements of historically trustworthy currencies eg gold as well as to introduce for the first time a number of characteristics that make it even better than all previously extant currencies  if people have trusted gold to date as a store of value because of its inherent scarcity and resistance to centralized control and pricesupply manipulation bitcoin does all that and more and does it all better gold s scarcity as illustrated above is anything but constant and we ve more than doubled our world s supply of gold in just the last 50 years bitcoin on the other hand has a precisely and publicly known proliferation schedule and will approach the limit of its supply in just a few more decades  as a thought exercise imagine a new fledgling nation called the united states came into formation and decided to create their own fiat currency today at the same time bitcoin is introduced as a currency  which would you trust my personal bet would be absolutely wholly and unequivocally bitcoin with the new us currency i would be effectively required to trust that the us government would act without fail over the entire course of its indefinite existence to practice perfect fiscally responsible habits and not screw up its economy in any dramatic ways i would also be aware that even under perfect circumstances the currency would be fundamentally designed to inflate and consequently my money would continue to lose value over time if i decided to hold and save it  furthermore i would be forced to use an intermediary financial institution such as a bank to hold my money for me and thereby expose myself to yet another layer of required trust and accompanying risk i would also be aware that these institutions would almost certainly practice fractional reserve banking to the maximum extent they could get away with it such that they would be extremely fragile to small perturbations and vulnerable to things like bank runs and runaway systemic banking collapses  on the other hand with bitcoin i wouldn t have to trust anyone at all i would know for certain that my coins wouldn t lose their value due to inflation as a consequence of their designed and indelible scarcity i would also know that as i stored my coins myself no one else not even a bank could actually go and spend 90 of my money and fail to give it back to me in the event of a bank run furthermore no one could forcibly confiscate my money under any circumstances as i could always store it in such a way that it could never be retrieved except with my consent no one would even necessarily be able to know how much money i held unless i chose to make that information public  remember just 13 years after its inception the us currency had already suffered fatal runaway inflation and collapsed bitcoin on the other hand is worth more than ever just 9 years after its inception and currently boasts a market cap of over 40 billion which would you trust  the other common argument against bitcoin is that it is useless for any real world functions right now besides ransomware and illegal activities and is therefore worthless because it has no good use cases  this is a fundamentally flawed argument that can be lobbied against absolutely any new technology or invention and fails to take into account the natural process of growth and gradual adoption over time the exact same argument was used against the internet in its early days and i find this article from newsweek published in 1995 particularly illuminating in this regard  after two decades online i m perplexed it s not that i haven t had a gas of a good time on the internet i ve met great people and even caught a hacker or two but today i m uneasy about this most trendy and oversold community visionaries see a future of telecommuting workers interactive libraries and multimedia classrooms they speak of electronic town meetings and virtual communities commerce and business will shift from offices and malls to networks and modems and the freedom of digital networks will make government more democratic  baloney do our computer pundits lack all common sense the truth in no online database will replace your daily newspaper no cdrom can take the place of a competent teacher and no computer network will change the way government works  what s striking in this is that while everything he said at the time was true and certainly none of those things were particularly possible back in 1995 it all came to pass eventually today remote workers are a huge part of the global workforce online education is booming amazon is taking over all of commerce and is larger than any retail store in the world print newspapers and magazines are dying left and right replaced by a proliferation of online news  the same growth trajectory is how i see bitcoin cryptocurrency and blockchain technology at large playing out if all goes well   and there s no guarantee it might everything indeed might fail and all our hopes and dreams might gang aft agley   there s no reason at all that bitcoin can t one day surpass even our wildest imaginations today just like the internet did before it and fundamentally rewrite the script for how we interact with money and the world as a whole  yes today it is far from this goal but even now we make progress in pushing forward the utility of bitcoin in every day pragmatic life already it has proved indispensable to myself and hundreds of thousands of people around the world i pay many of my employees today in bitcoin even because several of them live in eastern europe where they re subject to draconian capital controls  were i to send them a wire as i used to their banks demand a mountain of documentation detailing every last dollar and hold their money for upwards of half a month before ultimately releasing it to them naturally this is a pain in the ass and highly inefficient time consuming and resource intensive for all of us bitcoin easily sidesteps all of these issues  bitcoin is also dramatically cheaper to use than almost any other form of international money transfer today already for this use case alone it proves its worth over current dominant international money transfer solutions such as western union i can transfer money to anyone in the world in any amount and have them receive it without moving a finger in just a few minutes for this privilege i have to pay just a few cents no matter how much i m sending instead of a huge proportional percentage with hefty minimum fees and surcharges  it s also extremely convenient and valuable for a merchant to use and we had great success implementing it for a trial run at my company sprayable back in the day in the past we ve suffered from rampant fraud after our site was targeted on a carding forum a place where people buy and sell and use stolen credit cards when we were paid in bitcoin however these concerns were completely eliminated as fraud is an impossibility on the bitcoin network with enough confirmations  this is only the beginning you don t expect a horse to become a world champion racer straight from the womb it takes time training and a fair bit of luck the same is true of bitcoin and blockchain technology but just because a horse may not be a world champion just quite yet it doesn t mean you shouldn t bet on that horse in the long run if you see potential in that horse and are willing to wait it out for the long run go ahead bet on that horse one day it might just take over the world and if it does you might just win big  part ii investment philosophy  okay   now that you hopefully have a good grasp of what cryptocurrency is and why it s interesting we can move on to dipping your fingers in getting some  we can all be honest   the reason the vast majority of you are reading this is probably because you ve heard a lot about just how much money people have made investing in cryptocurrency many if not all of you are wondering how you too can get on the gravy train and start making millions  this isn t necessarily wrong or inaccurate this is the reason i first started paying attention to bitcoin countless people have made shocking amounts of money investing in cryptocurrency i ve personally made over 400000 in less than two years in fact bitcoin has already proven to be the best investment in all of recorded history by a shocking margin for those who got in at its most early stages  here s a story about a completely random norwegian student who bought 5000 bitcoins for 27 back in 2009 today with a single bitcoin pushing past 2700 those 5000 bitcoins are worth over 135 million that s a gain of over 500000x no other investment in recorded history that i ve been able to discover has ever come close to touching these sorts of gains  even the dutch tulip bubble which is classically regarded as one of the first instances of massive speculative market mania saw increases only on the magnitude of 10 100x   not even remotely close to 100000x and even the most successful of extremely risky angel investments in companies such as peter thiel s initial 500000 seed investment in facebook see returns on the scale of 10000x or so or less   thiel s 500000 investment had he held it all the way to the present day would be worth 68 billion or approximately a 13500x gain more incredible than just about anything else certainly but still nowhere even near bitcoin s meteoric rise in price  what s also striking is that traditionally these sorts of  angel or seed  investments in new technologies have been closed off to all but an incredibly well connected inner circle of elite high networth individuals and institutions peter thiel for instance was only approached to become facebook s first outside investor because he was already incredibly well known within silicon valley for having founded and sold paypal for over a billion dollars in contrast with bitcoin a random student in norway was able to invest just 27 and make millions  that said just as with everything there s survivorship bias here what you don t hear about are the profusion of people who lost their entire fortunes investing in cryptocurrency while there are a few ways you can beat all the odds and come out vastly ahead in cryptocurrency there are infinitely more ways you can lose everything you put into it and end up in a much worse place than where you started  here i ll try to cover the most common  mistakes  people have made do keep in mind that this is all entirely my own opinion please come to your own conclusions here  the most common mistake people seem to make is investing solely based on the price alone and its short term historical trajectory and nothing else the second mistake is investing in assets that they don t actually understand or believe in long term are not planning to hold for at least 5 years and will be tempted to sell if the price begins to fall in the short term the third mistake is believing that they ve already missed the boat on the most established and successful cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ethereum and that consequently they should invest in much less established much more speculative  altcoins  to achieve truly outsized gains for no truly good reason besides the fact that the pricemarket cap for the altcoin is a lot lower than bitcoin s and seems like it has more room to grow the fourth mistake is day trading and trying to capitalize on short term market movements i ll address each of these in turn and why i believe them to be mistakes  on the first mistake   i made this mistake myself when i first got into cryptocurrency i first heard about bitcoin from a friend who was raving that we should all get into it just around the time the price of a single bitcoin reached 100 he had gotten in at 30 and was extremely pleased with his gains  at the time it was relatively big news that bitcoin had reached 100 i remember thinking to myself that it was clearly too late to get in and promptly forgot all about bitcoin  the next time i heard about bitcoin was in the fall of 2013 when it began its last truly meteoric price rise from 100 all the way up to 1200 this time around i distinctly remembered thinking i d missed the boat back when the price was just 100 and kicked myself for being totally wrong i resolved to not make the same mistake again and tried to get in before i missed out again  i ended up wiring several thousand dollars to an incredibly sketchy russian exchange btcecom to purchase my first few bitcoins at around 1000 apiece before i knew it i was addicted to constantly checking the price and spent a full 48 hours doing nothing at the height of the november 2013 bubble doing nothing but refreshing btcecom and seeing how my investments were doing  i ended up making another big mistake here too and figured that bitcoin had already gone up way too much and that my best bet was to invest in some smaller altcoins as well i made this decision after seeing litecoin ltc skyrocket from 4 to 40 in just a few days the buzz at the time was that litecoin would be to silver what bitcoin was to gold the price seemed incredibly low compared to bitcoin and this made a superficial sort of sense meaning no sense at all so i decided to jump in for good measure i also decided to jump into a few of the other most popular altcoins of the time   peercoin ppc and namecoin nmc  the 2013 cryptocurrency bubble burst just a few days later brought on by the collapse of mt gox the largest bitcoin trading exchange at the time it was revealed that mt gox had either been hacked or embezzled from and no longer had any funds left to honor customer withdrawals as a result anyone who had decided to keep their bitcoins in mt gox at the time instead of withdrawing them to their own wallets ended up losing all their money how much the price of bitcoin rises doesn t mean anything if you lose all your bitcoins unfortunately  the price of bitcoin cratered about 80 falling all the way to about 200 before stabilizing at that price for much of 2014 and 2015 litecoin on the other hand fell from over 45 to about 1 and consequently lost over 975 of its value ppc and nmc suffered so badly that i didn t even bother to calculate how much i had lost because it was basically everything  this is when i first saw the light and realized that investing in altcoins that i didn t really believe in and that didn t really have any truly compelling reasons they would ever overtake bitcoin or deserve any level of market share was an incredibly foolish move it was certainly true that these altcoins did often gain on bitcoin and appreciated far more rapidly in many cases while the bubble held strong but the moment it began to collapse the altcoins were the first to go and often fell all the way to zero  as a general rule what goes up can come down and what goes up particularly quickly is privy to come down just as quickly this is not to say that things will come down if they go up but merely that they can and certainly have before this is particularly noteworthy today with ethereum having seen some truly wild gains this year all the way up from 7 back in december of last year to over 350 presently   a gain of 50x in just about half a year again this isn t to say ethereum will fall but merely that it very well might for any host of reasons and it s very important to keep this fact in mind and not overextend yourself with investments you perceive to be less volatile than they truly are i ll get back to this more later  what i ended up learning was something the smartest people in the investment world had learned a long time ago benjamin graham the mentor of warren buffett who became the richest man in the world by practicing the principle of value investing has a pretty wonderful analogy that i think is worth repeating here you should buy your stocks or any investment generally like you buy your groceries   not like you buy your perfume  what he means by that is that for some reason people tend to buy stocks when they re going up in price and sell them when they re going down at face value this makes no sense we wouldn t buy a watermelon when it was 10 and sell it when it was 2 with groceries it makes intrinsic sense to us to buy watermelons at 2 not 10 but seemingly not so with our investments  the short term price movements of a stock shouldn t concern a long term value investor in the slightest as a value investor doesn t care about what the market has valued the price of a stock at but rather only about the intrinsic value of the business behind the stock and its future potential value only after coming to a conclusion about the actual value of a company and its future potential value should an investor then look to what price the market has assigned a stock in ascertaining whether or not a stock is a good purchase  in the case of a watermelon what we intuitively grasp is that there is some fundamental intrinsic value to the watermelon and a  fair  price for it we have a general understanding of what this price should be and are more than happy to buy watermelons when they are on discount relative to their fair price and are reticent to do so when they are being sold at a premium to their fair price  if we decide that a watermelon s fair intrinsic value is 6 then we d be happy to buy watermelons all day long at 2 and reticent to do so at 10  with investments it s the same deal if we decide that company x is presently worth 100000 dollars and that it has strong growth potential in the future and the market is presently valuing company x at 50000 that would probably be a good buy  on the other hand if we decide company x is worth 100000 and has ambiguous future potential and the market is presently valuing it at 200000 it might not be such a good buy  in a third case if we decide company x is worth 100000 today and has extremely strong growth potential and the market is valuing it at 100000 today it might still be a good buy to hold and capitalize on that future potential  in all of these cases however a value investor first and foremost must decide with rigorous analysis and thorough examination what they believe the fair value of an investment to be and what degree of future potential it has only from there do they then examine what value the market has assigned the investment in order to ascertain whether or not the investment is a wise one likely to yield good returns under no circumstances should one ever buy into a stock without knowing much or anything at all about the stock save for the general market sentiment or hype surrounding it and its short term price movements buying a stock merely because it has seen great gains in the past without any understanding of why it saw those gains and what gains it might expect to see in the future based on fundamental analysis of the stock is an inordinately risky and foundationally bereft strategy  if you re interested in learning more about value investing at large i d highly recommend the intelligent investor by benjamin graham who again was warren buffett s personal mentor and a professor of economics at columbia university he pioneered a lot of the foundational concepts around value investing and can give you much better and more nuanced advice than i ever could  all of this said while these principles can and should be kept in mind at large for just about any investment cryptocurrencies are dramatically different from stocks bonds or any other sort of traditional investment vehicle they re also so early stage and so volatile that it s a nearcertainty that a value investor like benjamin graham wouldn t even dream of labeling such opportunities as investments rather than speculations at best they would be labeled growth investments but i m working with the buffett philosophy that there is no difference between  value  and  growth  investing and that good value investing appropriately takes into account growth  investments under this distinction would be clarified as things that could generally be safely assured not to suffer from dramatic catastrophic losses in the absence of dramatic catastrophic situations cocacola and walmart might be considered investments they ve been around for well over a century and a half century respectively are massive mature companies with a healthy track record of stable nonvolatile growth and show no general signs of turmoil that might portend a sudden collapse in value  speculations on the other hand are like the wild west of opportunities they re extremely high risk extremely volatile and could on one hand multiply one s principal manyfold and on the other dissipate it all into thin air a seed  investment  in facebook for instance could be considered a speculation in the vast majority of cases such an investment is likely to fail outright and lose all of the money invested in a few instances however that investment just might succeed and return tens hundreds or even thousands of times the principal invested  it s important to note that the mere fact that something is speculative does not necessarily mean it can t be a good investment or that it is merely akin to blind gambling dependent solely on the luck of the draw poker might be a suitable analogy poker can be played well or poorly and skill and calculation lends an incredible degree of advantage to a player s odds of success however the game still fundamentally deals with an immense degree of unavoidable variation and unknowns and even the best poker player is guaranteed to lose many of their games even if they play each one  perfectly  the goal simply is to win more than you lose and with the right amount of skill knowledge and preparation this is a possible feat in poker  the same might be said of speculative investments such as those in cryptocurrency you can and absolutely should do your part to learn as much as possible about this field and come to your own personal conclusions on its current and future potential value however no matter how much research you do and how many calculations you make there will always be a fundamental and inextricable degree of pure luck involved in determining the ultimate outcome of your speculation any number of future events could tip the scales for or against cryptocurrency or more specifically any one cryptocurrency and a number of these will be  black swan  events that are fundamentally unpredictable in their nature and timing but in aggregate whole almost certain to occur  just because there is this element of luck however does not mean that you necessarily shouldn t play the odds if you so believe with very good reason that those odds are in your favor what you do have to make sure of however is that you have such good reason to believe that those odds are in your favor and that you don t put up more than you can afford to lose given the odds the key takeaway and lesson to be learned again is to invest both in speculations and in  safer  investments based on firm knowledge of the underlying asset and intrinsic analysis to the extent possible and never merely based on price movements  in the case of bitcoin my personal belief is that there is enough to justify the possibility of long term gain based on fundamentals and first mover advantage if everything goes right i do see a future in which it s possible that bitcoin achieves a market cap similar to that of gold s given that so far as i can see it provides all the benefits gold does and a host of incredibly valuable advantages on top of those existing benefits i even see a future where it just might be possible that bitcoin goes even further and becomes a dominant leading global currency it s also possible that bitcoin s blockchain is used to power many future technological innovations such as smart contracts and even daos and thereby creates and imbues itself with even more value  at the same time i also see a million and one ways where bitcoin fails to reach the promised land bitcoin has already experienced numerous growing pains and at the present moment is suffering most acutely from a huge backlog of transactions that can t be fit on the blockchain this is because blocks are presently limited to 1 mb in size and can consequently fit only a small fraction of all the transactions that are trying to be propagated over the network this forces those who want to have their transactions go through to pay inordinately high transaction fees in order to prioritize their transaction over other transactions  there are already a number of proposed solutions to this issue such as the implementation of the lightning network but in order to implement these solutions the majority of bitcoin miners must agree to update their bitcoin software many bitcoin miners are reluctant to do so in large part because high transaction fees are good for miners at least on a short term basis as it means they earn far more per each block mined the implementation of the lightning network and other solutions threatens to take away this extra revenue stream hence users of bitcoin and miners of bitcoin find themselves at odds with a very understandable conflict of interest it s unclear as of yet how this will be resolved though it seems the community is pushing forward towards a resolution and i m of the personal belief that they ll get there eventually  similar problems like this are virtually guaranteed to occur in the future as well and it s simply impossible to predict right now how the bitcoin community might respond to and handle those problems and if they ll be successful in doing so  at the same time it s entirely unclear how governments will respond to bitcoin as it continues to grow and if they ll attempt to crack down in a very strong way and prohibit the use of bitcoin or the creation of bitcoin related service companies such as exchanges if exchanges were banned from operating for instance it could very well make it very difficult for most people to transact between fiat currencies and bitcoin and render the latter far less useful than it otherwise might be  on the flip side if the world suffers a global financial meltdown on the scale of the great depression or something similar again and fiat currencies start to crater it very well may be such that governments are forced to resort to accepting bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies if enough people simply flat out refuse to put their stock in fiat this was exactly what the us government was forced to do just 13 years into their original experiment with continental currency when they agreed to promise to back all the currency they issued with hard gold and silver  these are just a few of countless twists and turns and vicissitudes our much vaunted and much derided bitcoin will have to endure before its long journey comes to an end either six feet under or as an indelible fixture in our global economy there s no telling which way it will go and one must come to one s own conclusion on how much faith and conviction one chooses to place in bitcoin  that s the case as i see it for bitcoin in the case of most altcoins however i don t see remotely enough to even begin to justify the possibility of long term gain in the first place even with speculations or perhaps especially with speculations it s incredibly important to thoroughly analyze a given investment opportunity for at least the potential for long term gain and success and assess the magnitude of that possible gain and then to weigh that potential versus the likelihood of outright failure of the speculation with most altcoins their value over bitcoin or ethereum is far from clear and generally superficial or minor at best  dogecoin is the most pure example of this dogecoin offers just about no fundamental innovations over bitcoin and is in fact a selfdeprecating cryptocurrency premised initially at least entirely on poking fun at itself the name itself is a reference to the doge meme and offers little to no further justification for its existence  despite this fact dogecoin s market cap is presently valued at over 300 million come to your own conclusions here  less immediately obvious examples include things like litecoin litecoin too offers fundamentally no truly great innovations over bitcoin   in short nothing that bitcoin itself couldn t adopt over time it uses a different hashing algorithm and just adopted segregated witness the same update that bitcoin is debating adopting that would allow the implementation of layer two protocols such as the lightning network but beyond this doesn t have much in the way of unique differentiation going for it this said charlie lee the creator of litecoin and previously the director of engineering at coinbase one of the most well respected and successful bitcoin exchanges just announced his departure from coinbase to focus solely on improving litecoin it remains to be seen what will come from this endeavor as charlie certainly is without question one of the most accomplished and formidable players in the cryptocurrency sphere but largely litecoin appears to be a small hedge in the slight off chance that bitcoin doesn t actually manage to resolve its scaling issues and begins to catastrophically lose market adoption and faith and crumble into the ground in a case like that the notion is that litecoin would be able to quickly take over the ground lost by bitcoin and become the dominant cryptocurrency  there are a number of issues with this however and a lot of things would have to go right before this occurred there are several cryptocurrencies for instance with ethereum being the most notable that are already far larger than litecoin and it would have to be demonstrated that there s some reason something like ethereum couldn t simply take the place of bitcoin and that litecoin would have a better shot at doing so than the larger players that already exist in this space  litecoin would then have to deal with exactly the same issues bitcoin has faced at scale and it s not clear at all that litecoin would fare any better at resolving such conflicts if ever reaches the same scale as bitcoin presently has  all of this said it does seem extremely likely to me that there will inevitably be some true innovation in this space and that some cryptocurrencies will be able to carve out niches of varying degrees of value one might even prove to ultimately demonstrate so many more advantages as to overtake bitcoin one day   ethereum for instance is teetering remarkably close to doing just that at least in terms of market cap if not quite yet other markers such as developer activity and transaction volume the true feat here will be discerning those few new technologies with true fundamental potential and innovative advantage and an incredible execution strategy behind them from the vast swaths of similar looking yet ultimately worthless contenders almost certainly doomed to eventual failure  expected value is a useful concept frequently employed in poker that also serves to provide utility here in short expected value is a way to decide when an outcome is not certain but a set of outcomes are probabilistically determinable if a given action is going to be net positive or net negative and to what degree  the simplest example is flipping a coin this will yield heads 50 of the time and tails 50 of the time expected value of betting on the coin yielding heads hence is 0 this is because in any one given flip the coin has exactly a 50 chance of coming up heads hence if you bet 100 on the coin coming up heads an infinite number of times your expected gain or value from such an action is to be 0  conversely if you bet at even odds that a six sided dice roll would come up 3 or higher your expected value would be positive as you would be correct 23 times hence if you repeated this bet an infinite number of times you would be guaranteed to be earning more money than you lost  similarly if you were able to bet at 12 odds meaning if you bet 100 and win you get 200 that a coin would yield heads this would also be very ev positive expected value the coin would still yield heads half the time but that half of the time you would earn 200 and the other half of the time you would only lose 100 hence repeating this bet an infinite number of times would allow you to dramatically earn more money than you lost yet again  there are far too many variables and unknowns to take into consideration with most speculative bets and cryptocurrency in particular to be able to hope for anything so nice and clean as an exact mathematical probability of how  or ev a given bet on a given cryptocurrency might turn out just as there are far too many unknowns to calculate the precise fundamental present and future potential value of a cryptocurrency for the purpose of value investing analysis but regardless holding both principles at large as a general guiding strategy in determining one s actions here and elsewhere is a good bet  personally for myself a quick back of the napkin calculation that i can do to estimate the possible future value of bitcoin is to see what the market has valued all of the gold in the world at and use this as a rough guiding principle for seeing how much appetite the world currently has for something that can hedge against other currencies and holds similar characteristics to gold as a store of value i can see that the total value of all the gold in the world is over 8 trillion dollars and consequently if bitcoin were to reach that same total valuation each bitcoin assuming 21 million eventual bitcoins would be worth approximately 400000 dividing this by bitcoin s current value i can see that there s still room for approximately 150x gains this means that if i truly believe this is a possible outcome for bitcoin then as long as i believe this outcome has more than a 066 percent chance of happening or 1150 chances of success it would be an ev bet to make  that said it s extremely important to keep in mind that one doesn t get infinite opportunities to keep playing this bet out over and over again there is only one bitcoin in the world and we only have one opportunity to play out this exact bet given this fact it s important to realize that if this were somehow to actually be a perfectly ev neutral bet with a possibility of a 150x upside and a 066 chance of realizing that upside it would still mean that we have a 9933 chance of losing all our money that we place on this bet it would be extremely foolish therefore to invest all our money into such a wildly speculative investment even if it is technically ev neutral or even slightly ev positive what might make sense is to set aside a responsibly proportionate amount of money specifically earmarked for such wildly speculative investments as a part of a holistic investment portfolio that one is fully willing and able to lose without significant impact to one s wellbeing or quality of life and to invest that amount of money in a ev bet like this  returning to the question of calculating potential investment upside here there are countless other ways to make projections on the future potential value of bitcoin and i encourage you to try to make some depending on your personal beliefs regarding the level of success bitcoin might have and the ultimate utility it might provide to the world for instance if you see bitcoin primarily as a way to simplify making international transactions and cut out inefficiencies there you might look to see what the overall market size is for a solution that might solve that problem and capture that market western union as one example is a company with a market cap of 9 billion consequently it might be reasonable to expect that bitcoin s true ultimate value would be something roughly in that order of magnitude if this were to be bitcoin s one true long term use case  if you see bitcoin as most useful for its blockchain you might calculate hence the value you think can be created through applications contracts and other technological innovations run on the blockchain and use that to guide your estimation of bitcoin s value  if you think bitcoin will be used to primarily enable black market transactions same deal and so on  i hope that this elucidation provides some insight into why i personally see it as suspect to invest in something based on price alone and why i urge extreme caution particularly if one is exploring whether or not to invest in an altcoin especially if one is at least partially motivated to do so because of the feeling that the ship has already sailed for bitcoin and that there might be better potential for outsized gains with a smaller altcoin again this certainly may be true and often is true even for altcoins destined for eventual failure in the short term while a bubblebull market continues but risks are amplified just as much as the opportunity itself when it comes to altcoins and oftentimes moreso in a bubble than otherwise  it s easy to be swept away in the fervor of a frenetic market and the fear of missing out can be overwhelming especially when you see altcoins rising by wild amounts overnight but my personal guiding philosophy is to always try to keep in mind fundamentals to the maximum extent possible to never invest in anything i don t actually understand or see long term value in and to only invest in things i intend to hold very long term for at least 5 years especially in such a volatile market  speaking to that last point now the  second  mistake i mentioned at the beginning of this part i m of the personal opinion that it is incredibly important to not only invest solely in things that i truly believe have the real potential to succeed in a big way long term but to actually commit and hold to that investment once i make it no matter what happens with the price short term if some fundamental fact underlying my investment changes i can certainly reevaluate it but if the price drops 90 or even 95 in the short term for no particular reason except a collapse of a local maximum in price speculation eg a bubble popping i must never be tempted to sell and try to  time  the market in any way instead i have to hold that investment with firm conviction in what i believe the eventual price based on fundamentals is worth regardless of how the market values it in the present moment  this is critically important precisely for incredibly volatile speculative investments such as cryptocurrency and plays into the fourth mistake i mentioned above day trading as well more than possibly any other market i ve seen short term price movements for cryptocurrencies are oftentimes absolutely mystifying and nothing short of mind boggling highly anticipated events such as halvings in bitcoin s reward per block mined come and go without any real perturbation in price other times things rise when reason seems to suggest they should fall and fall when they seem to have every reason to rise for instance bitcoin s price collapsed to 200 after the bubble popped in 2013 and stayed stagnant at those levels despite massive development in bitcoin infrastructure and significant growth in the adoption and usage of bitcoin over that same period of time  more recently the approval or rejection of a bitcoin etf was widely touted as being the contributing factor to a bitcoin bull run from under 1000 to over 1200 it was speculated that if the etf were to be rejected that naturally the price would fall to where it was before the bull run began indeed the moment the etf was announced as rejected the price did momentarily fall to almost 1000 however it just as quickly recovered and began an inexorable climb all the way up to over 2700 where it stands to this day  consequently with the short term price movements of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies being incredibly volatile and oftentimes nothing short of inexplicable i highly caution anyone against making decisions such as selling their bitcoins on the way down in anticipation of a market crash so as to either avoid the crash or to buy their coins back at a cheaper price at the bottom of the crash  this goes hand in hand with mistake number four i mentioned above day trading this is absolutely number one the reason i see people who have gotten into bitcoin and cryptocurrency lose their money if you at almost any point in the history of bitcoin earlier than say this month of june merely bought bitcoin and held it to the present day you would have made money however countless people have actually lost money in bitcoin and this is because they ended up trading their bitcoin somewhere along the way  i would venture to say that most people have far more confidence in their ability to predict short term market movements than is actually the case i ve seen plenty of instances of people who have thought that they could capitalize on short term volatility on the way up and essentially  buy the dips and sell the tips  and in every single instance i can recall this strategy eventually fails and often in a big way at face value this seems to make sense if you think you can time when the dips will occur and when they will end and similarly when the peaks will occur and when those will end you can definitely make more profit along the way by selling high and buying low  however as i ve mentioned before this is far more difficult if not impossible to do with cryptocurrency more than even normal investment vehicles like stocks i ve seen people who think that bitcoin has hit a peak and must necessarily stop going up sell intending to wait until bitcoin falls again to buy in again and make maybe a 20 extra profit miss out entirely because bitcoin kept going up and never came back down there are numerous stories of those who bought into bitcoin at 1 or less but sold well before it ever reached even 10 much less 2500    real friends getting real screwed with real money  with something as speculative as cryptocurrency in the first place it makes no sense to invest in this space to begin with if your only goal is to make 20 profit it almost certainly isn t worth the risk at that level of gain hence risking losing out on the long term upside of 10x that you ve calculated and come to the conclusion does exist for a gain of less than 1x or 5x in most cases makes little to no sense at all it only makes sense if it s essentially a guaranteed gain with no risk and that again is almost certainly not the case  indeed some market movements are fundamentally unpredictable in their short term timing two very vivid examples of this were the collapse of mt gox for bitcoin and the hacking of the dao for ethereum both of these events absolutely cratered the price of bitcoin and ethereum respectively and both of them were fundamentally unpredictable in their exact timing these are examples of the black swan events i mentioned that are certain to continue playing a large role in short term price developments for bitcoin and all other cryptocurrencies at large that make it doubly dangerous for those who day trade  i ve also seen plenty of people who intend to hold long term but lose faith when they see their investment crater 30 50 or even 70 at this point they lose faith and decide to sell their investment to at least recoup some of their initial capital and not lose everything outright thus they end up buying high and selling low and then having double regret when bitcoin eventually ended up rebounding even higher than the  high  they bought at  this illustrates even more vividly why it s incredibly dangerous to invest in anything you don t actually believe in and aren t willing to hold long term if you aren t going to hold something long term then generally you must believe that while the price will rise in the short term it will not continue to rise in the long term if you hold this belief it generally means that there s some reason that you believe what you are investing in won t hold true value long term but that there is enough speculative mania in the short term to make the price go up anyway the thinking goes that if this is going to be true you might as well profit from this speculative mania and buy in now wait for a little bit for the price to rise and then sell it for short term profit  the problem with this is that just about everyone else investing in these things is thinking the same thing and everyone involved is effectively playing the greater fool theory expecting that they will be smarter than everyone else and be able to time the market better than everyone else and get out before everyone else does and before the price eventually collapses by mere inviolable fact most people who engage in this form of speculation are guaranteed to lose in a big way over enough iterations the eventual likelihood of loss generally grows to become one in my opinion as one must continue to time a market correctly time and time again for this to work while it may seem like the market will continue being bullish for you to get in and get out before things go south this is true of every moment in time right up until things go south all at once inevitably at some point the gravy train will have to derail and explode in a rolling ball of fire  i know for a fact that i m certainly not remotely smart or knowledgeable enough to pull off this kind of short term investment that aims to profit from market sentiment alone especially not in the turbulent mercurial waters of cryptocurrency and that s all i can say about this here on top of this the existence of black swan events that can crater an entire market unpredictably short term introduces a variable that inherently is just about impossible to predict and makes short term bets like this even more dangerous  the most dangerous game of all then in my opinion is day trading in altcoins that one doesn t believe in long term this is basically combining every  mistake  i mention above trading in something because of short term price movements not holding it long term day trading and speculating in highly risky small cap altcoins if you manage to survive doing this over any long period of time 5 years let s say and end up net profitable particularly if you end up more profitable than just buying and holding over that same period of time please do let me know as i d be extremely curious to hear just how you pulled it off  going back to my personal story ultimately the crash from 1200 to 200 for bitcoin was the best thing that could have ever possibly happened to me at the time of course it certainly didn t feel that way it felt like i had made an absolutely stupid foolish decision and had lost all my money in fact i did make a stupid foolish decision but not for the reason i thought at the time i didn t make a stupid foolish decision because the price had cratered to 200 i made a stupid foolish decision in deciding to invest in bitcoin and altcoins without actually having done my research and without really knowing anything about them  had i actually done my research and believed that it was a fair bet to make that one day bitcoins would be worth far more than even the height of the local maximum bubble at the time it absolutely could have been the right decision to buy in then even if it crashed later temporarily to 200 what wasn t right was buying in simply because the price was going up and i had a fear of missing out  the crash proved to be the best thing that could have happened however because it gave me time to actually do my research and learn about bitcoin and have real reasons for believing in it long term at a point in time where the price was unusually deflated as a consequence i was able to buy more bitcoin at the very bottom of the market around 230 or so when i became truly convinced of bitcoin s long term potential i was also lucky enough to decide not to sell the bitcoins i had originally purchased for 1000 or so and ultimately saw even those return 250 in profit  it was at this time incidentally that coinbase became worried about stagnant growth of their user base and decided to offer a truly astounding proposition they offered to pay anyone who referred a new customer to coinbase 75 if the new customer purchased just 100 in bitcoin coinbase took a 1 transaction fee at the time meaning that for every 100 in bitcoin a person purchased coinbase charged 1 in short coinbase would pay out 75 for every 1 a new customer paid them  it didn t take a genius to see a clear arbitrage opportunity here and i wrote up a quick blog post detailing this opportunity and fired out a single facebook post telling my friends about it from that post and just a few hours of work i ended up earning almost 17 bitcoins entirely for free   worth over 45000 today i had plans to scale this strategy en masse but singlehandedly ended up killing the program almost as soon as it started when coinbase finally came to its senses and realized just how much money it was hemorrhaging here with no hope for eventual recoupment at the time the lifetime value of the average customer was only something like 25 to coinbase   a far cry from the 75 they were offering  digression aside that sums up most of the thoughts i have about the primary things to be cautious about when it comes to bitcoin investment there are a few more practical matters to be extremely cautious about namely how you store your cryptocurrency but i ll address those in the next part which will be an actual howto guide showing actually actionable steps for those interested in getting into bitcoin investment  the final point to make then are a few thoughts on how to correctly invest in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies i have no truly great pieces of wisdom to offer here but do have a few ideas that primarily aid in being psychologically being resilient to the short term vicissitudes of cryptocurrency investment  once you ve decided that you truly believe in a cryptocurrency long term and are willing to commit to it for the long term and hold it no matter what the short term price movements might be the next step is to decide how much to invest and when to invest one might be hesitant with not bad reason to invest at an all time high even if one believes that that all time high will one day be exceeded  the mere fact that the future potential is still huge doesn t necessarily preclude the fact that cryptocurrency may be in a short term bubble and that prices might crater any day by 30 50 80 or even more  generally the strategy suggested to average out such short term volatility for something that one is investing in long term is to practice dollar cost averaging this preaches that one should set an exact time at regular time intervals to buy an exact amount in fiat currency of the investment one is looking to purchase   eg 1000 worth of bitcoin on the 1st of every week or every month this means that over time you ll be able to take advantage of bitcoin s general trajectory upwards but balance out the relative short term volatile price movements both high and low such that you experience a more linear growth trajectory over time of your principal  i think that this is a great strategy and personally practice it with a few modifications while i ll never sell at any price essentially unlike other investments bitcoin and cryptocurrencies are unique in that they are currencies and consequently if they succeed you won t have to sell them to gain value from them you can just use them directly just as you might us dollars or any other form of currency in the manner that i use the word sell here however i mean that i likely won t sell at any price under 100000 as that s where i personally see the moonshot value of bitcoin going towards in the slight chance that it does succeed no matter how high the price rises in the short term if and when the price becomes particularly low as a result of a cratering market i will look to buy more than i normally would to double down on my investment here   all the while keeping in mind never to invest more than i m perfectly willing to lose entirely  psychologically if it s helpful i think it may be fine to sell off some small portion of your upside if you do realize upside over time in order to recoup your initially invested principal i don t think that this is necessarily the most optimal actual move to make but do think it likely makes a huge difference psychologically such that it makes it far easier for you to hold your remaining investment with sangfroid in the case that it ends up cratering sometime in the future  as for investing an initial lump sum to begin getting exposure in this space my personal strategy would be to do a semitimed dollar cost average if one is particularly concerned that they might be investing just before a local minimum market crash but also particularly concerned that the price may keep rapidly appreciating ad infinitum and would like to get in before that happens that is i d decide the total lump sum i d be willing to set aside to invest here say 10000 and invest 33 or 50 of it immediately then if the market did crash i d be psychologically very happy and be super excited to invest another 33 or 50 on the flip side if the market continued to rise indefinitely and never fell again i d also be happy that at least i was able to get exposure to the market and didn t miss out entirely a 33 33 33 split would allow me to invest 3 times when i felt the market was at a particularly good time for investment and a 50 50 split twice just random arbitrary examples of divisions i might do here depending on how exactly wary i feel about the market at the present moment in time  that about sums up my thoughts on cryptocurrency investment at large there are some nuances but i figure 8000 words worth of a brain dump is a good enough place to start if you re still here please feel free to read on to part iii if your constitution allows for further word consumption  part iii how to buy and store your cryptocurrency  the shortest section by far if you made it this far you deserve to just be able to buy your crypto and be done with it all i ll try to make that as easy as possible there are still quite a few bases to cover however  note the following bit about exchanges to use holds true for those in the united states for those based elsewhere you ll need to do your own research on the best exchanges to use in your country the rest of this post should hold the same for everyone in the world however  the easiest way to invest is to sign up at coinbasecom if you sign up with a referral code you get 10 when you purchase 100 in bitcoin or ether i ve linked my mom s referral code here if anyone is interested straight to her retirement fund in the interest of having zero monetary gain from my fiduciary advice however just email me if you use this link and buy over 100 of bitcoin and i ll send you the whole 10 my mom receives on her end as a referrer   so you get 20 for investing 100 not bad sorry never mind i ve been overwhelmed with these messages and can t keep manually doing this but you re still welcome to use the code and get a free 10 and give my mom a free 10 too  however this is not the cheapest way to invest that s gdaxcom no referral bonus with this though thankfully gdaxcom is the same company as coinbase and utilizes the same login once you make your coinbase account you can just login with it to gdaxcom  at gdaxcom which is coinbase s exchange you re able to get trades in for either 0 as a market maker meaning you limit buy or sell and set your own price and  make  the market or 025 as a market taker meaning you just buy or sell at whatever price the market is currently at with a market buy  you can trade immediately as much as you want by sending a wire only applicable for us customers to your account following their deposit instructions there s a 10 fee for this that gdax charges on top of whatever your bank charges to send wire transactions this is the fastest method to deposit any amount of money you want and trade immediately with no limits but not the cheapest  you can alternatively conduct ach withdrawals from your bank as well by going to the coinbase accounts page clicking on your  usd wallet  and clicking the deposit button in the top right hand corner these are completely free but take anywhere from four business days to a week to complete  you can even use a credit card to buy straight from coinbasecom but fees here are very hefty use as a last resort  keep in mind that while you can put however much money you want into gdax at any point in time you are generally limited to withdrawing 10000 per 24 hour period thus if you are buying a large amount of say ethereum to send to a token sale address keep in mind that if you want to send over 10000 you ll need to purchase that amount and withdraw it well in advance of the token sale  for instance if you wanted to send 100000 of ethereum somewhere you d need to buy all that ethereum and withdraw over the course of 10 days assuming you withdrew perfectly each day every 24 hours   realistically more like 11 14 days back to coinbase or your personal ethereum wallet before you could then send that ethereum on to somewhere else all at one time like you would need to do in a token sale  on gdax you can buy bitcoin ethereum or litecoin  from there if you d like to buy any alternative currencies you can use your bitcoin or ethereum on shapeshiftio without any account to instantly transfer your bitcoin or ethereum to any other cryptocurrency under the sun essentially  to buysell on coinbase or gdax you need no wallet as coinbasegdax will keep your coins for you you ll want to enable google authenticator for two factor authentication and keep your passwords and your phone incredibly secure however as if someone hacks your account all your money is gone for good with no recourse this happens a lot use a super strong password that you have not used elsewhere and that no one knows and that you won t forget  ideally you ll keep the coins yourself on your own hardware device which is ultra secure i recommend trezorio as of this writing they ve just run out of stock but are only backordered a few days if you re willing to pay a premium for this purpose ledger nano s is also good and cheaper to boot but i personally haven t used it and it s very backordered in sales i can recommend trezor 100 wholeheartedly however  trezor will keep your coins safe because the device itself is immune to hacking by design and never exposes your private keys the passwords to your accounts essentially even if your computer is infected by malware and is logging all your typingpasswords or is specifically scanning for private keys or is engaging in any other form of sneaky bad behavior  it does this by signing all transactions on the device itself using your private key and only transmitting the signature to your computer and never your private key as a general rule this is very good because a good rule of thumb is to never expose your private keys to the internet under the assumption that the internet is inherently insecure and if you ever have your private keys interact in any direct way with a computer that has been connected to the internet you should consider the addresses those private keys correspond to to be compromised and vulnerable to being hacked  a trezor also allows you to set multiple passwords that open secret vaults to different wallets on your device such that even if in some crazy scenario someone just kidnaps you and threatens to beat you with a wrench until you give them your coins not too crazy actually   i ve been abducted before and had to ransom myself for thousands of dollars in africa you can just give them a second password to another wallet that holds say 500 in cryptocurrency instead of 10 million and there s no way for them to know that that s not all the money you had on your trezor  if someone steals your trezor they won t be able to find your coins either as they re protected by a pin that only you know plus a password if you want to use that feature i mentioned above you can also recover the coins yourself with the recovery seed the trezor will give you the first time you use it which you should store in a super safe location like a safe deposit box somewhere if you don t use utilize the password feature however keep in mind that anyone who discovers this recovery seed instantly has access to all your coins and all your other forms of security are for naught if you enable the password feature however they will need your password as well as the recovery seed in able to access your cryptocurrency which makes it significantly more secure  a trezor will give you your own personal wallets for bitcoin ethereum dash zcash and litecoin as well as any erc20 token built on top of ethereum  another benefit of holding coins yourself in a hardware wallet or elsewhere is that you know that you 100 own all of your money exchanges are just like banks in the sense that you trust them to hold your money for you if they end up losing that money to hackers or stealing it themselves you re out of luck this isn t just a scary bedtime story   countless cryptocurrency exchanges have been embezzled or hacked an enormous percentage actually and hundreds of millions of dollars have been lost  moreover in the event of a hard fork whereby two blockchains are created and consequently two sets of coins that you technically should own only some exchanges will actually give you access to both sets of coins most notably coinbase has explicitly stated that they will only give you access to the dominant blockchain that emerges from a hard fork no matter how much value the market assigns the nondominant chain they may or may not give you access to the other coins in the future but there is no guarantee either way in any event with any exchange you are fundamentally agreeing to trust them to give you access to both sets of your coins even if they say they will if you own your coins yourself in your own wallet however you need to trust no one you will automatically own both sets of coins by default in the event of any fork  this too is not merely a theoretical matter ethereum did indeed hard fork after the dao hack and split off into eth the current dominant blockchain for ethereum and etc the  classic  or original blockchain for ethereum as of this time etc is worth over 20 a coin   more in fact than all of ethereum was worth before the hack had i kept my ethereum on coinbase or another exchange like it at the time of the hard fork i personally would have lost 5 figures in etc at present values merely because the exchanges wouldn t give me access to these coins that i rightfully owned  finally my personal preference is to avoid keeping all my eggs in one basket despite the fact that a hardware wallet like trezor is technically one of the most secure options for keeping your coins safe with a fair amount of redundancy in recovery options the fact remains that one day i might somehow lose access to my coins held within trezor i might suffer a concussion for instance that causes me to forget the password or the pin required to access the trezor or perhaps i lose my trezor and am unable to locate or decipher my recovery seed  because of this i actually personally keep my cryptocurrency distributed in several reasonably safe baskets for instance despite coinbase being an exchange that fundamentally requires some trust they are more trustworthy than almost any other exchange on a technical level their customer service however leaves something to be desired and it is virtually impossible for their coins to be hacked to any significant degree and all those at risk of being hacked are fully insured as a consequence i leave some of my coins with them merely because in many ways i trust their technical security measures more than i trust my own before gbtc started trading at such an absurd premium i also kept some of my funds with them both in part to diversify across multiple platforms to reduce the risk of losing all my coins with one bad black swan event and also because it was the only immediately easy way to put some of my retirement funds into bitcoin short of creating a self directed ira  okay   so that s about it for investing in the dominant cryptocurrencies available today if you want to invest in other more speculative altcoins you ll have to create your own wallets for them and investigate the best and most secure solution for doing so yourself this should generally be a good exercise in any case to determine if you meet the bare minimum requirements for responsible investment in a given altcoin    ',\n",

spain frenchspeaking africa mexico and uae by end2019 discodery is targeting 1000 customers worldwide and should be selling its solution in central and south america whole africa australia and asia by mid2020  regarding the discodery concept as a whole digital payments are legitimately at the heart of the solution four money exchange channels are today used on a daily basis  end customers need to collect money from their own customers as a compensation for their online sales whether it is from their mobile application or from their website  they also have the opportunity to create a digital loyalty program to reward their customers in the form of discounts or products  in the meantime they need to pay to discodery their recurring subscription  and on its side discodery needs to reward the discodery partners for their sales  all these exchanges of money are now possible on the discodery solution but are complicated mainly because of the lack of technical solution in developing countries we and our customers are also facing difficulties to send and receive money because of high currency conversion fees our vision about discoin  first of all when writing a white paper a fundamental question needs to be asked why we at discodery do we think we need our own digital coin   because we and our customers have a real business problem to solve when it comes to online payments and recurring payments in some markets   because we love doing thing ourselves and are very passionate about the technology behind the blockchain concept as a whole   because we love understanding what we are doing at a technical level   because we want to build our own community that will decide the future technological improvements of our blockchain and digital coin of course   because we want to introduce new security concepts   ecause it is a unique opportunity for an initial coin offering to finance the development of the discodery project and the growth of our company   because it facilitates the distribution of our first digital coins in the world  the second fundamental question is what are we going to do with our digital coin  our vision is to give access to the discoin ecosystem to every business owner and every ecommerce platform developer we defined a clear road map to achieve this goal see  the discoin roadmap  here were the few use cases anticipated at the time of writing this white paper   get access to the discodery ecosystem more information about it can be found at httpsdiscoderycom by instantly paying in discoins your periodical subscription or by turning on an automatic debit from your wallet   purchase items to enhance your digital environment domain names emails addresses custom templates etc   get rewarded by sharing about discodery and the discoin on your social networks from your digital environment control panel the gravity board   get rewarded by referring other people to join the discoin adventure and subscribe to the discodery ecosystem   and really soon receive customers payments in discoins from your website or mobile application  of course this list is not exhaustive and will necessarily be completed over time with other use cases  the discoin technology  the discoin is derived from the cryptonote project an opensource technology and concepts for the cryptocurrencies of the future  untraceable payments  discoin payments are untraceable thanks to a completely anonymous payment schema implementing a ring signature technology  this ring signature technology is a more sophisticated scheme of transaction verification that implies several different public keys in comparison traditional transaction verification involves only the public key of the signer the one who initiate the transaction  in the ring signature algorithm groups of individuals with their own key pair are established for each transaction a member of a group can sign a transaction with his own secret key but the public keys of all the others members of his group are required to validate the transaction this ring signature algorithm is a oneway process and cannot be reversed that way it is technically impossible to determine who the initial signer was among all the individuals of the group  unlinkable transactions  receivers have multiple unique onetime addresses derived from their single public key which makes it impossible to crosslink payments  with this principle the cryptonote algorithm solved the fact that everyone was able to check all the incoming transactions and thus the resulting balance of a given public address  thanks to a change in the diffiehellman exchange protocol the sender now uses the receiver s public address and his own random data to compute a unique onetime key for the payment the sender can produce only the public part of the key whereas only the receiver can compute the private part  the receiver is the only one who can release the funds after the transaction is committed he only needs to perform a singleformula check involving his private key on each transaction to establish if it belongs to him no third party can perform this check and discover the link between the onetime key generated by the sender and the receiver s unique public address  doublespending proof  in the crytponote implementation of the ring signature algorithm a linkability feature has been added to restrict a signer to create more than one ring signature using the same private key which would indicate a doublespending attempt  to support linkability a special marker called a key image has been added to every signature the key image is the value of a cryptographic oneway function of the secret key onewayness means that given only the key image it is impossible to recover the private key on the other hand it is computationally impossible to find a collision two different private keys which have the same image using any formula except for the specified one will result in an unverifiable signature all things considered the key image is unavoidable unambiguous and yet an anonymous marker of the private key  all users keep the list of the used key images compared with the history of all valid transactions it requires an insignificant amount of storage and immediately reject any new ring signature with a duplicate key image it will not identify the misbehaving user but it does prevent any doublespending attempts caused by malicious intentions or software errors  blockchain analysis resistance  the unique onetime addresses and the ring signature make the whole blockchain resistant to analysis  since every ring signature produces ambiguity there are billions of possible graphs linking addresses with transactions moreover every next transaction increases the entropy of the whole blockchain and creates additional obstacles for an analyst  egalitarian proof of work  the proof of work mechanism is actually a voting system users vote for the right order of the transactions for enabling new features in the protocol and for the honest money supply distribution therefore it is important that during the voting process all participants have equal voting rights cryptonote brings the equality with an egalitarian proofofwork pricing function which is perfectly suitable for ordinary pcs  adaptive limits  a decentralized payment system must not depend on a single person s decisions even if this person is a core developer hard constants and magic numbers in the code deter the system s evolution and therefore should be eliminated or at least be cut down to the minimum every crucial limit like max block size or min fee amount should be recalculated based on the system s previous state therefore it always changes adaptively and independently allowing the network to develop on its own  cryptonote has the following parameters which adjust automatically for each new block   difficulty the general idea of the algorithm is to sum all the work that nodes performed during the last 720 blocks and divide it by the time they have spent to accomplish it the measure of the work is the corresponding difficulty value for each of the blocks the time is calculated as follows sort all the 720 timestamps and cut off 20 of the outliers the range of the rest 600 values is the time which was spent about 80 of the corresponding blocks   max block size let mn be the median value of the last n blocks sizes then the  hardlimit  for the size of accepting blocks is 2mn it averts blockchain bloating but still allows the limit to slowly grow with the time if necessary transaction size does not need to be explicitly limited it is bounded by the size of the block  wallets  as exposed in our road map see  the discoin roadmap the discoin web wallet is the first released shortly after gui desktop and smartphone wallets will be released to facilitate the decentralization  the command line wallet is of course available on our github at httpsgithubcomdiscoderydiscoingit  exchanges  as exposed in our road map see  the discoin roadmap an integrated exchange platform will be released by the end of 2019 to allow the trading of discoins first in eur in the meantime we will work very hard to bring discoin to several popular public exchanges  deep integration  the discoin is going to be deeply integrated into the discodery ecosystem allowing to subscribe to one of the best digital solution with automatic recursive payments and to collect payments from endcustomers later the same level of functionality will be featured in the discoin public payment gateway api  mining  mining is available for everyone who wants to share his computing power to join the discoin miners simply download and compile the discoin binaries from our github at https githubcomdiscoderydiscoingit and follow the readme instructions  a discoin mining pool is available at stratumtcpdiscoinminingpooldiscoderycom 3333 algorithm to use is cryptonote  everyone is welcomed to join and grow the discoin miners community  payments are made automatically to the discoin address given to the pool when the miner balance reaches 1000 discoins  rewards and sharing  mining is of course an easy way to obtain some discoin as a reward for calculating power but it is not the only way because the discoin is deeply integrated with the discodery digital solution anyone can be rewarded in discoins by sharing about discodery or the discoin and by bringing new customers to the platform the discoin initial distribution  from the beginning it was planned to give the discoin an important but limited supply  a total of 2000000000 discoin will be emitted a relative fast emission curve has also voluntarily been chosen the objective was to emit 50 of all the discoins after one year from may 2018 to may 2019 and reward more prominently the first contributors miners of the project after its official launch june 2019  it allowed the discodery team to premine around 1000000000 coins during one year of thought about the project and development these coins will be dedicated to the airdrop and ico phases of the project and will help rewards several contributors to the project that weren t always paid in fiat money until then  the discoin ico  how and why  in order to help us grow the discoin project the ico perspective has been considered  the main goal of the ico will be to support the launch of the discoin as a cryptocurrency asset and help discodery grow around the discoin by integrating it in its ecosystem and by opening public apis the funds are planned to be used this way   40 for the growth of the it and development team   30 for marketing and advertisement   15 for legal implications around the project   15 for the remuneration of the founding team  last but not least the minimum investment amount has been fixed to  10 and two investment options will be offered from the official discoin dashboard   by credit card handled by the integration of the stripe payment platform   with a bitcoin deposit handled by a random wallet generation for each transaction   the ico has started in june 2019  phases and caps  the ico takes place in two steps   a presale in which each discoin bought will be rewarded by one additional free discoin this phase has a maximum cap of  250000 when this cap will be reached the ico will automatically enter the next step   a mainsale in which each two discoins bought will be rewarded by on free discoin this phase has a soft cap of  2000000 and a hard cap of  8000000  after the ico the discoin will be introduced on the market at  0025 per discoin  rules  the following ico rules have been established   the participation in the ico is not limited and everyone can choose to participate more than once in each phase   the coins distribution including bonus will occur at the end of each ico phase please create at least one discoin wallet before you will be contacted by email before the end of the corresponding phase if you invested and did not create a wallet   if the ico does not come to an end the sums will be reimbursed up to 80 to handle our processing fees  additionally because the regulations are pretty strict we will ask every participant in the ico to fulfill the following conditions   complete kyc before investing valid first name last name email phone personal address and id card scan are required the profile validation will be done manually for each investor   due to national regulations usa canada iran iraq syria and north korea will not be part of the discoin project and heir residents will not be allowed to participate in the discoin ico  the discoin airdrop  during six months after the official launch of the project june 2019 to late november 2019 several airdrop bonus programs will take place from the official discoin dashboard available at httpsdiscoinappdiscoderycom  during these airdrops each participant that completes successfully his profile will be rewarded with 400 discoins a successfully completed profile consists of   a registration with a valid email address   a filled up profile first and last names country twitter and discord username   a valid discoin address  a referral program has also been implemented allowing every participant to share the discoin airdrop program each validated referred profile will give an additional reward of 100 discoins to the referrer  finally a bonus section will reward every participant a random discoin amount between 025 and 1 the participation is limited to one per day per member  the accumulated coins will be transferred all the way through the end of the airdrop once the registrations have been validated it could take up to one month to limit the risk of fraud of course the discoin airdrop is limited to one participation per person anyone trying to mess with the system will see his account suspended and all his participation in the airdrop cancelled  the discoin founding team  the team behind the creation of the discoin is composed of the five founders of discodery below is a quick presentation of each one of them  we sincerely hope that our team will

       " 'in the last few days many have asked about my investment strategy and portfolio mix after writing 95percent s blockchain technology  after much deliberation in this post i ve decided to share my holdings with you perhaps more importantly i ve decided to also share my underlying philosophy as a reminder i know nothing none of this should be construed as investment advice and you should do your own research before making any investments i would be financially okay if i lost all of my invested money you should make sure you could survive a total loss before investing any funds  but enough of that how should you approach investing in cryptocurrencies first i advocate creating your own investment tenets tenets are also a crucial aspect of the product management process i recommend creating tenets before diving into any business project or problem  why do we write tenets   tenets are used to make hard decisions   each tenet expresses the conflict arising from two or more competing philosophies   each tenet ultimately demonstrates preference for one philosophy over others  most people have their own philosophies and preferences but they don t write them down writing them out is crucial because it crystalizes your thinking tenets are helpful when times are good and indispensable when things get tough you should debate your tenets heavily with family friends and yourself below i share five of my cryptocurrency investment tenets  jason s cryptocurrency tenets january 2018  1 i will prioritize platform investments think ethereum over application investments think dash strong infrastructure scales and changes the world successful applications are hard to predict and are not stable over time platforms better withstand changing customer needs  2 i will choose cryptocurrencies with user adoption and strong focus on user adoption over cryptocurrencies with the latest tech or prettiest whitepapers  3 i will take the superlong term view i will prioritize cryptocurrency that have the potential to be trillion dollar businesses and will stay away from currencies with more barriers to widespread adoption if a cryptocurrency is unlikely to ever be used en masse i won t buy it i investment in fundamentals not merely public opinion  4 i will greatly value signals in the market especially signals from entities with inside information and large investment positions   potentially over even my own analysis  5 i value cryptocurrencies that demonstrate the ability to change direction pivot quickly and make decisions over cryptocurrencies that emphasize status quo tradition and moving wisely but slowly i recognize this is partly a function of team structure and leadership  after painstakingly working through my tenets i ve researched many of the cryptocoins available today based on my personal investment philosophy and this research i ve made several investments over the last month here s my positions as of january 11th 2018  jason s cryptocurrency portfolio as of january 11th 2018   ethereum 50   stellar 20   neo 20   request network 10  i ve rounded these numbers to make them prettier  ethereum 50  as we wrote in blockchain technology  blockchain technology creates information networks the fundamental rule of networks is that when a new person joins any network the network becomes exponentially more valuable as a corollary each time another person joins a widelyused network it becomes exponentially harder for competing networks to offer similar value to people you use facebook because all of your friends are on the platform you are less likely to use a new social network because few of your friends would be on it as a result networks tend to produce winnertakesall markets facebook wechat and a few other businesses for example dominate the social networking space we expect a similar winnertakeall outcome for blockchain technology so far founders have created many hundreds of digital coins they will create thousands more over the next few years we expect a handful of these digital coins to successfully walk out onto the global stage while the vast majority of these coins will ultimately become valueless   amazon is a platform facebook is a platform platforms dominate the internet as we ve seen from ethereum s creation of the initial coin offering ico platform platform coins will dominate the blockchain coin as well we ll see many cryptocoins repositioning themselves as platform coins especially starting in the second half of 2018 and into 2019 when many smaller more niche coins start to flame out based on my research ethereum is currently best positioned to win the platform war pure and simple i may change my view in the next few months or quarters but for now ethereum gets the majority of my money  stellar 20  stellar is a platform that wants to make it really easy for companies to ico versus using ethereum stellar is ultrafocused on this use case but that s okay because this use case is massive  again per blockchain technology  blockchain technology can also make physicalworld assets more liquid easier to sell and buy by making them more reducible in other words the blockchain better facilitates ownership of assets across multiple people  while megacompanies eg amazon airbnb have successfully built their own digital marketplaces in the past blockchain provides the availabletoall trustbuilding lowcost financial infrastructure via smart contracts secure transactions and an authoritative ledger to almost anyone unlike crowdfunding sites like kickstarter where early backers receive nothing but a product or service icos let entities actually own part of meaningful ideas   the tokenization of assets via blockchain is going to change the world so far this use case is the only one ethereum has proved it can solve and i find it possible that stellar eats some of ethereum s pie i am watching stellar carefully stellar focuses on usability think mvp instead of extensibility think useless features the founder started mt gox and built the initial framework for ripple stellar is backed by stripe and has support from top advisors in tech  neo 20  over the last decade china has made it clear that they want to build their own solutions to world problems i expect this trend to continue into the blockchain world and expect at least a duopoly platform paradigm at least one major smart contract platform for the west and at least one smart contract platform for the east  request network 10  request network is a platform specifically focused on the payments space built on top of ethereum while the sized of the tokenization of assets space eg ico is almost incalculable the payments space remains enormous request network is a big team bet as a product leader i value team organization a lot i ve studied the core developers of many of the top blockchain coins and find that most projects are being run relatively poorly compared to more traditional software development projects today partly a function of decentralization of blockchain teams many teams don t have updated visions or project plans and as a result miss deadlines and seem to be prioritizing things no one wants request network strikes me as agile able to pivot quickly and ruthlessly focused on user growth and customer experience i love the biweekly updates i also immensely value their time in ycombinator the top startup incubator in the world  like the preblockchain startup world reallife customer feedback is everything i want a team desperate to get their coin to market from there they can interact with real customers and then make technical changes that are likely to lead to meaningful improvements for real customers  mainstream cryptocoins i am not invested in  bitcoin  in my opinion a huge milestone for blockchain technology will be to move away from the bitcoin hegemony right now the cryptocurrency market as whole is psychologically entwined with bitcoin when bitcoin plummets the market plummets although we ve seen signs of change in the last few weeks in 2018 i predict that ethereum or another platform will surpass bitcoin the cryptocurrency market will finally detangle itself from bitcoin  i don t find probitcoin arguments particularly strong initially bitcoin initially saw a lot of success helping entities perform discreet transactions think silk road currently though bitcoin isn t particularly helpful in the payments space slow expensive and unfocused the digital currency is unlikely to scale to widespread user adoption for payments bitcoin also can t help with icos it is not a platform perhaps most concerning from a development perspective bitcoin moves slowly has divided leadership and doesn t practice userdriven development at least compared to other digital coins proponents cite these characteristics as advantages and argue that bitcoin is a store of value  we flesh out the digital coin role as a store of value in blockchain technology  blockchain technology also has potential to provide a new independent store of value today the classic independent store of value gold is partly valuable because humans have decided to value it independently of nation states eg canada or nation alliances eg the european union unlike other mainstream currencies eg the united states dollar is closely tied to the success of the united states of america gold is generally inversely correlated with the us dollar in other words gold acts as a hedge against the current global financial system because gold is difficult to store   heavy relatively insecure   digital blockchaincurrencies represent an attractive alternative if digital currencies become more stable over time currently they are extremely volatile they may one day augment or supplement assets such as gold   the problem is that no one uses bitcoin as a stable store of value today additionally bitcoin is relatively uncorrelated with the us dollar so it doesn t act as a particularly useful hedge ultimately i think digital coins will be strong store of values but this is far far down the road at that point i find that other cryptocoins are just as likely or more likely to act as global store of values compared to bitcoin  i further argued that the bigger and more immediate store of value opportunity is  helping entities buy into the global financial system in the first place in developing countries for example many entities are eager to shift local unstable currencies to stable currencies such as the us dollar to better protect their wealth like the us dollar today the blockchainbacked currencies that facilitate world transactions tomorrow will also naturally act as a store of value entities will invest in these currencies as they do the us dollar today as a result the same blockchainbased currencies that gain mainstream adoption for payments are also likely to gain mainstream adoption as stores of value  we will be forever indebted to bitcoin but 2018 will mark ethereum passing bitcoin the marketing falling and then ultimately rebounding stronger than before the age of the blockchain platform is beginning  privacycentric cryptocoin  while private fullyanonymous transactions are a large blockchain use case coins emphasizing privacy will struggle to gain mass adoption in the longterm i expect privacycentric coins to bear the brunt of initial government scrutiny and regulation i choose to make my investments on the more public side of the blockchain movement that said monero would be my current pick in the privacycentric digital coin space  ripple  as we wrote in blockchain technology  in the shortterm partial blockchain solutions like ripple will become common already financial institutions are creating their own private blockchain networks and producing digital coin participating institutions act as nodes in the blockchain and have visibility into all transaction on the shared digital ledger   i like ripple and particularly the focus on getting customers like many others however i am concerned about the difference between the highlyvaluable ripple payment protocol and xrp as an investment vehicle i also see inhouse blockchain development from large institutions as meaningful competition  thanks  hopefully my perspective is helpful if i helped you crystallize your own thinking i d very much appreciate a small donation to my ethereum wallet   ethereum wallet 0x81ff5029a05ce15c3b6d6e27c7d89a7c30ecaf32  or just clap a lot   to trade i buy ethereum in coinbase and then move these coins into binance  coinbase httpswwwcoinbasecomjoin5a39ac52c9e83802d5f70a27  binance httpswwwbinancecomref18572991  again this is not investment advice i readjust my portfolio constantly based on new information and could have a completely different set of investments tomorrow one must be careful not to be affected by sunk cost or fear of missing out biases   and strive to act as objectively as possible good luck    ',\n",
       " 'neo is a platform with a purpose can it compete with ethereum or better yet does it even need to    why read this article  neo and ethereum   which pill will you take sorry couldn t help myself we care about this debate because we re investors from a developer s perspective functionality is the most important there is no brand loyalty in blockchain yet so if a platform can do something better than its competitors it will win over developers so which one does it better  this article is long because i have chewed through all the information i could find about neo and ethereum and digested it for you there are lots of articles summarizing the  differences  between ethereum and neo but they do the debate little justice they skim over things don t explore them well explore only one aspect or aren t holistic in their analysis and don t explain why the differences even matter and what their relevance to the real world is i was frustrated by the lack of a comprehensive article this article is my response  i will admit that i explored neo more indepth than ethereum this is because so much information is widely available for ethereum with neo there is much less as such i focus on explaining neo and then comparing that explanation to ethereum s capability  so bear with me grab yourself an espresso and lock yourself in that room you  do work in  this will be well worth your time i also won t blame you if you just read the tldr   too lazy didn t read   under the articles  let s begin  if ethereum is goliath neo is david if ethereum is brad pitt neo is brad pitt s cousin zach pitt younger better dressed and more talented   but right now relegated to serving cocktails to brad and his friends while he acts on the side ethereum did it first it was revolutionary and exciting and took the crypto world by storm web 30 today almost every ico is built on ethereum s erc20 token platform and vitalik buterin is one of our time s greatest minds yet if we ve learned anything from the fact that alibaba is closing in on amazon s market cap and wechat dominates china s social media scene it s that china plays by their own rules the land of the red dragon uses their own technology their own networks and cares little for what the us is doing the question is can neo compete with ethereum and does it even need to  ultimately neo and ethereum are aiming for similar roles in the crypto community both want to be platforms for the new internet for dapps decentralized applications icos initial coin offerings and smart contracts  overview of ethereum and neo  while both neo and ethereum have generalized blockchains that provide a toolbox for would be developers their objectives differ i would summarize each platform s objectives as such    ethereum s goal is to create a platform for the development of dapps in order to create a  more globally accessible more free and more trustworthy internet  an internet 30    neo is a blockchain project  that utilizes blockchain technology and digital identity to digitize assets to automate the management of digital assets using smart contracts and to realize a  smart economy  with a distributed network   that s a mouthful let s breakdown these objectives to fully understand the projects it s important to understand that both platforms share many of the same capabilities but the distinction in their branded objectives is very important  ethereum ethereum s goal is to be the platform for dapps and they are largely accomplishing this they own the dapp market right now their roadmap is all about giving users and developers more control and more options in developing their applications  neo neo is working towards developing a product for the future it not only rebranded from antshares to neo in june of 2017 but they refocused their marketing as well   with enormous success neo s objective while ultimately utilizing many of the same technologies as ethereum is to be the platform for a new smart economy  in short ethereum is developing in response to new demands neo is developing their platform in anticipation of future demands  what is a smart economy  the biggest difference between neo and ethereum is neo s focus on a smart economy if we want to fully understand neo we need to understand why this distinction is important  a smart economy will feature digitized physical assets all of these newly digitized assets will have proof of ownership in the blockchain these assets can be sold traded and leveraged through smart contracts their ownership can be protected and validated through the decentralized model of the blockchain we ve already seen iterations of this from proposed supply chain overhaul to daos decentralized autonomous organizations   essentially decentralized companies without a leader i offered some real world examples of this economy in this article now while ethereum will likely support many of the same capabilities that neo has the distinction between ethereum and neo s objectives is what we care about    the distinction is important because a smart economy will still be under a government and under governmental regulation i don t trust the government as much as your next libertarian i ve read 1984 too many times but the fact remains that governments aren t going anywhere thus for a platform to service this  smart economy  that platform needs to put specific thought and intention into how it will accommodate governmental regulation so while ethereum might offer the similar blockchain capabilities the fact that neo is developing for this purpose is crucial  tldr a smart economy is in our future to accommodate the needs of this smart economy the platform will need to be specifically designed for this new economy  what is neo doing to prepare itself for the smart economy  neo places particular emphasis on staying regulatory compliant  to do this they need    governments don t love these guys  digital identity  anonymity is great i think privacy should be at the forefront of today s technological developments and discussions but if companies and governments are operating on the blockchain digitizing their assets and issuing smart contracts all under the watchful eye of the government they can t have anonymity for a platform to be regulatory compliant digital identity   a verifiable identity in digital form   is a necessary evil  today digital identity is based on a system called the pki public key infrastructure x509 standard this probably means about as much as it does to you as it does to me it just means that there is an international agreed upon standard for what constitutes a digital identity neo s plan is to issue digital identities in accordance to this standard and then secure them using the blockchain bookkeepers read about them later will have digital identities and real names because of this judicial action can be taken against them if ever need be this is imperative when registering financial assets on the network and staying regulatory compliant  there could also be businesses and projects that will only transact with people who have a digital identity for regulatory reasons neo enables that possibility  neo is already working in a strategic partnership with thekey   a project being developed on neo s platform that will assist with providing digital identification  what about ethereum ethereum requires other dapps to develop digital identities which can then be secured on the ethereum blockchain this isn t so unlike how it will work with neo   however neo has made it clear through its plan to incorporate digital identity with its bookkeeper nodes that integration of digital identity is of central importance to the neo ecosystem  tldr governments don t like anonymity industries don t like pissing off the government if neo wants industrial adoption it needs to have digital identities  digital assets    a future digital asset  if you want a smart economy based on smart contracts you need to be able to leverage and exchange assets beyond currency we need to be able to digitize assets like house property and car ownership gold diamonds and other precious elements computers clothes and food even those baseball cards your mom keeps begging you to throw away smart contracts become so much more powerful when we have the ability to digitize all of these assets  what about ethereum very similar to the digital identity blurb ethereum absolutely can secure digital assets but they won t necessarily be regulatory compliant neo is ensuring that issued digital asset certificates will be compliant  tdlr just read it  neo s complex network  the economy is complex it has so many interconnected pieces neo s platform is complex with partnerships galore fully researching and understanding this is difficult but i did it so you don t have to refer back to this visual to have a solid picture of how this network interacts    even though this looks like the deranged drawings of a conspiracist it will make sense as you reference it while learning about neo s network    onchain  neo s founders da hongfei and erik zhang founded a company called onchain understanding onchain is critical to understanding neo they re not the same company but their interests align and they have a partnership together onchain s system known as dna decentralized network architecture aims to work with chinese businesses and government neo acts as the foundation of dna if onchain can integrate with chinese businesses and government that will greatly spur adoption of neo  ultimately dna develops public and private blockchains for businesses these blockchains then link up to neo to join the decentralized economy businesses then have all the benefits of both private and public blockchains think of neo as providing the public blockchains and onchain s dna providing the private blockchains then they can link up and get the best of both worlds  onchain also has several projects and partnerships and newsworthy mentions that all contribute to the dna ecosystem  1 established in 2014 this is not a freshofftheshelf company  2 first chinese blockchain company to join hyperledger   a collaboration of projects that work towards integrating blockchain with established businesses  3 legal chain   works with microsoft china in digitizing and securing signatures via blockchain technology  4 strategic partner of microsoft china on multiple projects  5 worked with the japanese ministry of economy trade and industry  6 voted as kpmg s top 50 fintech company in china  7 partnership with alibaba to provide an email certification service for ali cloud  8 investment from fosun group china s largest private conglomerate   to integrate onchain across their businesses  9 collaboration with chinese regional government   using onchain to develop public services and digital identity  onchain s recent development was of the ico ontology ontology uses the same architecture as neo but ultimately works with businesses in creating a private encrypted data network essentially this is important when we have information that we need securing but we also need it to be private this will enable people to bring this information in a secure manner to blockchains  references on onchain s roadmap  honestly i don t understand why neo doesn t advertise their collaboration with onchain more neo in itself is solid offering several potential benefits over ethereum but combined with onchain neo truly has the potential to implement itself as the smart economy platform of the east  the ethereum comparison ethereum s equivalent is the enterprise ethereum alliance an open source blockchain initiative dedicated to linking ethereum with the business world their list of partnerships is robust and impressive   no surprise for those familiar with ethereum included among their members are bp hp toyota mastercard microsoft and intel among many others  tldr onchain is a company partnered with neo they have extensive experience and many accolades in bringing blockchain to businesses they work with companies and governments in the east they are a huge component to neo s potential  neox  neox is neo s version of atomic swaps directly swapping tokens without any exchange and crosschain integration think ark ecosystem this will enable people to swap crypto assets and transact across different blockchains it also allows smart contracts to interact across chains  neox is important because it allows collaboration between the blockchains both private and public created by onchain and by neo s public blockchain as more components of the smart economy develop neox will link them all together  ethereum comparison ethereum has the ability to do atomic swaps but has only completed this once   this isn t to put down ethereum neo has never completed one however ethereum will need an outside application to accommodate large scale crosschain integration    not quite the city of zion we re talking about   city of zion  city of zion coz is an independent open source community of developers translators and designers who work towards the betterment of neo they have received funding from neo to help incentivize project development the community has contributed considerably to neo they have developed the neon wallet created a neo block scanner translated documents for neo and developed the nex platform see below they recently received neo funding to award 270000 to 10 winners as part of their dapp competition it is incredibly advantageous to have a network of support such as coz  ethereum comparison there isn t really a good comparison for this on the ethereum network  nex  nex is an upcoming ico developed by city of zion that offers a platform for the creation of payment solutions and decentralized exchanges on neo it links to neo with neox  because of differences with neo in the token model account balances and way smart contract interact   in comparison to ethereum   neo needed a solution to be able to effectively house decentralized exchanges nex offers that solution  ethereum comparison already erc20 tokens are easy to transact with on decentralized exchanges  projectico  a turnkey allinone ico company that helps blockchain companies develop from initial idea to ico they recently decided to move from ethereum to neo they have an interesting reddit ama on their reasons for switching  ethereum comparison tokenhub is a similar project developing on ethereum  microsoft china  neo is currently hosting a developer competition in partnership with microsoft china with 490000 as prize money  ethereum comparison ethereum is incredibly well connected with established corporations neo is playing catchup  dapps and icos  the bread and butter of platforms until now neo has only had one ico red pulse and one dapp adex however with several planned in the near future and with an upgrade last month which will enable neo smart contracts to interact with website interfaces i think this is only the beginning for neo  ethereum comparison ethereum hands down beats neo in this area ethereum is the goto platform for icos and dapps  ecosystem recap  we hopefully have a strong understanding of the differences in the goals of ethereum and neo as well as a good overview of neo s network and the network s advantages in the smart economy it s important to understand this network for neo because neo is more than just a public blockchain it is a piece in the larger picture when neo s public blockchain can link up with onchain s private and business oriented blockchains and ultimately with all other dapps on it s platform it could truly become a smart economy  the biggest differences between ethereum and neo    ethereum s energy consumption could power 1025438 american homes for a year   source    protocol  ethereum uses the same protocol as bitcoin   proof of work pow with proof of work computers on the network compete to solve mathematical formulas and win the right to confirm transactions into the blockchain and thus secure the network the two major drawbacks to the pow protocol is the danger of a 51 attack and the massive energy consumption required for network security for these reasons i think that pow will soon be an outdated system as blockchain transitions to a new protocol called proof of stake pos  proof of stake works similarly to pow except that instead of computers validating the network and receiving rewards equivalent to their relative computing power pos uses token holders those who hold tokens can  stake  their tokens staking means to temporarily place the tokens in a locked smart contract until staking is over and in exchange confirm transactions and receive rewards based on the relative number of tokens held in pow if you operate 5 of the total computing power of the network you can expect to get 5 of the block rewards in pos if you own 5 of tokens you can also expect to receive 5 of block rewards  pos offers a solution to the issues plaguing pow   mainly it takes virtually no energy to run pos   without compromising the security i would argue that it actually improves security with ethereum and all other pow protocols the difficulty algorithm how hard it is to solve the mathematical formula must constantly be updated to account for better computer hardware and more powerful mining groups with pos there is no need to do this with ethereum you could conceivably purchase enough computing hardware to achieve a 51 attack even after comprising the network you would still have all of that hardware and could potentially use it to attack other pow platforms with pos because you must stake your coins any malicious behavior results in the loss of all staked coins so if you bought 51 of all tokens you would immediately lose your substantial investment in addition the costs of purchasing 51 of the network tokens are equal for everyone the costs of obtaining 51 of computer power   due to discounts for mass computer purchases and countries with extremely cheap electricity   are not    byzantine fault tolerance attempts to solve the byzantine general s problem  neo uses a protocol called dbft delegated byzantine fault tolerance sounds like a term you d see on your ap history test the simplest explanation of byzantine fault tolerance is the issue with how to get everyone on the network to be honest and work together   because one bad apple could ruin everything neo s dbft is a modification of the classic pos protocol with some significant advantages and one primary disadvantage  i imagine dbft as working similar to how the us senate works and if that analogy made you want to just give up on neo entirely i understand but hold on keep reading if every person in america   all 3231 million was allowed to directly participate in the governmental decision making process it would be catastrophic it would be brutally slow as millions competed for the microphone all shouting their opinion and arguing with each other making decisions would also be agonizingly slow so instead everyone in the country gets a vote and with this vote they can elect their representatives someone to speak for them this system directly reflects neo s governance instead of everyone participating in the validating process   which can be incredibly limiting in terms of transaction speed   those who hold neo tokens can vote for delegates these delegates called bookkeepers maintain the network for everyone thus neo can run faster more efficiently and with quicker and more finite decisions and you can stay home drink bud light and watch the patriots game with your computer in sleep mode  remember too that these bookkeepers will have their digital identity known making neo much more compliant with national regulations  the disadvantage with this system is a lack of decentralization in its purest sense instead of thousands of validators being scattered all across the world governance is concentrated in a few dozen validators the majority of these nodes are currently operated by the neo team however as of quarter 1 2018 neo will hold less than 23 and will continue to hold fewer as time progresses regardless neo will never be as decentralized as other pure pos platforms  i would however argue that ethereum is also not as decentralized as you might think while the pow protocol is decentralized you can count the number of core developer s for ethereum on one hand in addition while i trust vitalik buterin he does have enormous power and influence over the direction of ethereum  ethereum will transition to a pos protocol in the future they already have begun the process and the mining difficulty of confirming new blocks will increase exponentially until it is impossible to mine anymore and everyone must transition to the pos protocol this will happen but it is likely more than a year out  tldr ethereum uses a proof of work protocol and will evolve into proof of stake neo uses a delegated byzantine fault tolerance dbft protocol which is a modification of the standard proof of stake protocol    transaction speed  because neo doesn t run on pow and has a more streamlined pos protocol neo can process transactions far more quickly than ethereum now when we compare these there are both theoretical and practical speeds theoretical transaction speeds are the absolute maximum speed mathematically possible for the network for neo this number is 10000tps transactionssecond ethereum can do 30tps in practicality because of real world inconsistencies and difficulties neo can do 1000tps in comparison to ethereum s 15tps as protocols improve it is possible that both platforms will approach their theoretical speed  this is an enormous difference and a massive advantage for neo neo s transaction speeds could conceivably accommodate the kind of smart economy they re envisioning ethereum s can not now in exchange for this speed neo is not as decentralized as ethereum in addition it s important to recognize that vitalik and ethereum are well aware of this limitation solutions such as raiden and sharding two fascinating technologies but far beyond the scope of this article are on the roadmap for ethereum and could drastically improve ethereum s transaction speed  tldr ethereum can transact at 15tps with a maximum of 30tps neo can transact at 1000tps with a maximum of 10000tps ethereum has plans and solutions to scale to close this gap  forking and scaling  ethereum forks to update its software just like bitcoin i describe this here forks aren t necessarily bad but they certainly can be look at ethereum s dao fork for an example of this after millions were stolen from an ethereum smart contract ethereum forked to refund the money to the original holders whether or not this decision was correct it divided the community and ethereum classic was created alongside ethereum  forks happen because there is no finality in the consensus mechanism of ethereum multiple chains in the blockchain can be created at once   ultimately both are valid chains and can continued to be mined on forks happen constantly but are usually resolved when the chain with the most computer power is chosen as legitimate with ethereum it s always recommended that when you place a transaction you wait until a few blocks have been mined on top of yours before considering the transaction permanent  neo has finality this is because the bookkeepers must reach a 66 consensus for the transaction to be placed into the blockchain here is an analogy to understand this imagine a first grade class timmy asks how much chocolate milk costs cynthia has no concept of price she s in first grade for god s sake and shouts 15 a few students walk over to her in agreement bobby s a chocolate milk aficionado   he knows his milk he says 125 most of the room walks over to him he has a majority now assuming cynthia s group realizes their flaw and joins bobby s group then the group reaches consensus but if cynthia is having a particularly stubborn day she could keep on with her decision   a fork it might not be the right answer but she still has a valid answer this is how ethereum works    only in israel do they have chocolate milk in a bag   neo works like this imagine the same scenario timmy again asks how much chocolate milk costs first cynthia speaks up  15  a few murmur in support but it s clearly not 66 of the class so her idea is discarded next bobby says  125  66 of the class support his claim and thus his idea is final with neo the bookkeepers each propose the correct state of the next block when 66 of them support the proposition the block is finalized  the implications of this are huge finality is incredibly important for the type of economy neo hopes to support the financial industry and other complicated fast moving markets stock markets for example can t operate on a system without finality they need to know that when their information is placed into the blockchain it is there for good they also need the assurance that their blockchain won t suddenly become irrelevant because of a fork  tldr ethereum can fork neo can t   this is important for adoption by our real world economy  decoupling of gas and neo  this may very well be neo s most ingenious characteristic the native token of ethereum is ether the gas needed to run the ethereum network execute contracts conduct transactions etc is actually just small units of ether there is no separation between ether and gas  however neo decoupled itself from the token needed to run the network gas the neo token is like partial ownership of the neo platform neo token holders are entitled to vote for bookkeepers neo s use as a share in the company rather than a token is furthered by the fact that neo is nondivisible neo is not meant to be transacted with   that s why there is gas  gas is used for all operations on the neo network now when a company registers or changes assets on the neo blockchain they pay in gas   this gas is then distributed to all neo holders anyone can claim this gas by just holding their neo in a personal wallet such as this one neon  bookkeepers are entitled to charge a transaction fee in gas for general transactions on the blockchain that only they the bookkeepers receive however by decoupling neo and gas there is an incentive to keep transaction fees low here s why  high transaction fees which only benefit the bookkeepers will prevent people from wanting to register their assets on the blockchain the less assets registered the less rewards neo holders will get thus neo holders are incentivized to vote in bookkeepers who will keep transaction fees low    low transaction fees  more users  more assets registered  more gas to neo holders      malcolm lerider   from his article  bookkeepers are primarily incentivized by their desire to secure the network they use the network benefit from it and have money staked in neo thus it is advantageous for them to secure it  it is unclear how rewards will be divided amongst ether holders when ethereum becomes proof of stake however it appears that only large ethereum holders will be able to stake and receive rewards    the neon wallet with the  claim gas  button  the genius of the neo token is that it allows users to passively acquire gas in their wallet no need to run the computer keep the wallet open or expend electricity no need to  stake  your tokens   bookkeepers do this for you you could even have your neo in a paper wallet gas is collected when you physically push the  claim gas  button this also ensures that the neo network doesn t need to calculate the interest of neo holders with every block reducing traffic and simplifying the compound interest formulas the delegated bookkeepers maintain the network your investment gains interest this would not be possible without two separate tokens  both neo and gas are capped at 100 million tokens  tldr ethereum has one token ether neo has two neo and gas there are huge advantages to having two tokens when using a proof of stake protocol    source  smart contract language  the biggest difference between ethereum and neo smart contracts is the coding language options available with ethereum contracts must be written in solidity   a coding language created specifically for ethereum neo on the other hand supports a variety of different languages including the most commonly known neo supports five programming languages with plans to support an additional five in the future  there are certainly advantages to crafting a particular language for a particular platform ethereum developers designed solidity for ethereum however far fewer people know solidity by supporting the most common coding languages neo has an advantage in facilitating adoption most programmers today would have to learn solidity before working with ethereum whereas with neo their knowledge is already applicable it s also possible that existing business platforms could be placed onto the neo blockchain without much modification  tldr seriously it s like two paragraphs ethereum has one coding language solidity neo supports many different coding languages  smart contract execution  smart contracts use what are called virtual machines vm essentially in layman s terms virtual machines are machines that execute smart contracts and run inside the computers of miners or other validators the vm is the environment that the smart contract runs in thus if we want to know how efficient and effective smart contracts can be we need to analyze the vm    neo s vm optimizes smart contract code before executing the contract what this means is that it takes the code and reorganizes it to make it more efficient imagine your mom gives you a grocery list if it s anything like my mom s lists   and she will probably object to this   the items have no organization and i am constantly pingponging back and forth across the grocery store but by organizing all the items into categories that i can then pick up together at the same part of the store dairy canned goods cereals my job becomes much quicker and easier neo does this ethereum does not now while this makes things much easier in the long run in the initial phase it takes a bit longer to organize the list neo s contract execution takes slightly longer than ethereum s but is much more efficient in the long run  ethereum plans to roll out this mechanism but there is no timeline for it ultimately this allows neo to execute and run complex smart contracts faster and more efficiently than ethereum  tldr neo has a more efficient and faster way of executing smart contracts than ethereum  additional important differences  1 neo is theoretically quantum computer resistant ethereum is not   when quantum computers develop enough blockchains could be vulnerable neo has theoretically designed their blockchain to account for this ethereum does not have that capability  2 sksnarks ethereum s new privacy tool sksnarks is the privacy protocol of zcash while there are far smarter people who can explain the technology far more intelligently than me essentially sksnarks is important when we want to have data or contracts whose contents are private or confidential we need to maintain the privacy of the data but at the same time prove we have ownership of it sksnarks allows users to prove they have ownership without actually giving up the private data neo has no such capabilities however neo s partnership with onchain s ontology offers neo a privacy solution for businesses  neo s recipe for success  in my opinion neo has two possible avenues for success neo s two paths towards success are  1 the above mentioned benefits allow it to compete with ethereum directly and it begins to be the goto platform for icos and blockchain development  2 it doesn t compete with ethereum but instead becomes the dapp platform and foundation of a smart economy in the east  the first possibility  i think this is the least likely of the two paths to success yes neo beats ethereum on several fronts but ethereum already is an established platform and ethereum will close the gap with its scaling plans in the future to overtake ethereum will be very difficult however i do think that neo has a lot more room to grow even if it can t fully compete with ethereum already we ve seen an influx of icos developing on neo   this will increase and as it does neo s price will increase i also believe that eventually the market will support more than one platform but that doesn t mean neo will ever replace ethereum especially in the west  the second possibility   some political analysis in here too  this is definitely the most exciting of the two possibilities take the almost 14 billion chinese add to that an even larger untapped market in the surrounding area and that means that the blockchain platform that captures this market will make ethereum s 44 billion marketcap look like chump change and as i wrote about before china uses their own products and businesses the issue is we don t even know if china is looking for a platform currently china has banned all icos and exchanges if the ban continues no one will capture the chinese ico market   because there will be nothing to capture so the question then is if   and it s a big if   china legalizes icos can neo be the big man on the block    in my opinion china will soon open up blockchain development china right now sees an opportunity to be a global political and economical leader already with the world s second largest gdp china is not afraid to adapt and evolve for the benefit of their economy their dedication to renewable energy exemplifies this china was certainly not known for their environmental friendliness but they recognized that the world was moving in that direction they recognized the benefits it offered and they recognized the enormous potential if they could lead the pack and now china is the leading investor in renewable energy  additionally china s political structure means that development can happen fast they can evolve quickly and lead world renewable energy efforts because they are a oneparty state there is no balance of power and need to appeal to a divided voter base delaying development as there is in america  china knows that blockchain is going to be extraordinarily disruptive they demonstrated this when they released their fiveyear blockchain plan china banned exchanges and icos because they recognize the potential of blockchain if they didn t understand its significance they never would have banned it they banned it because they want to control it because they will control it they banned it to flex their muscles establish their power and give them time to formulate a plan for how and when they will move forward it s very difficult to influence things when adoption has come it s much easier to impose early restrictions and shape the direction of the disruption  when they have their plan they will likely become the world s leading country in blockchain technology and with the capability for rapid economic development when china opens up icos and blockchain development look out  the question then is what will china utilize it s possible that they design their own governmental blockchain services but i think this is incredibly unlikely china integrated with social media not by banning it or by creating their own platform instead they integrated by selectively banning western social media and directing the chinese market to tencent   in exchange tencent employs communist workers stays regulatory compliant and maintains the party s censorship and now tencent is bigger than facebook thus i believe that china will join the blockchain world by integrating with an already present platform one with a willingness to work with the chinese government one with a focus and framework that will support governmental compliance neo and onchain fit that mold their work and partnerships within china neo s development and dedication to compliance and their envisioned smart economy gives me confidence that when the day comes neo could be china s platform  recognize that this is my own opinion nothing is guaranteed especially in the crypto space all we can do is formulate a hypothesis and provide a strong supporting argument i hope that i at least did that  summary  ultimately if i had to categorize neo and ethereum in a few words i would say that neo is ethereum but with a specific purpose to enable a smart economy ethereum is just a platform to enable entrepreneurship innovation and development   the direction it goes is up to those individuals building on ethereum neo has a direction it is shaping its platform with a goal in mind  yes neo has some definite advantages over ethereum but as i said ethereum will likely scale to close the gap as the platform gains adoption neo s true value is in its dedication towards fitting the mold for a regulatory compliant smart economy platform they are doing this now china just needs to takes notice    ',\n",
       " 'the bubble i haven t heard the word used so much since my third grade birthday party it is the kryptonite of every crypto investor the most common first question cnbc s favorite buzzword no matter the reporter it s always delivered with the same deerintheheadlights look and the disclaimer  we actually have no idea what we re talking about   every time i hear someone claim that cryptocurrencies are in a bubble i fight an instinctual desire to contradict them like listening to someone badly misquote your favorite movie most make the bubble claim without any semblance of understanding of blockchain bitcoin or bubbles but while the cnbc reporter is simply throwing darts blindfolded and hoping he hits the bullseye there may be some truth to these bubble claims    don t misquote pulp fiction  first the definition of a bubble  trade in an asset at a price or price range that strongly exceeds the asset s intrinsic value   there are two metrics i will use speculation and application we speculate on what application the asset will have always contrasted by its actual application the biggest bubbles always occur when the potential for disruption is enormous this creates the largest discrepancy between the speculation and the application this is why a new noise canceling headphone technology probably wouldn t result in a bubble the application of the technology is very clear   to drown out the cries of airborne babies   and thus there s not much room for speculation we can base assumptions off the current headphone industry and besides the technology only affects one industry so its potential for massive disruption is limited  consider for a minute the internet during its onset or especially distributed ledger technologies dlt   a term encompassing all distributed ledger tech dag hashgraph etc today the internet threatened and has now revolutionized nearly every industry in existence today dlt has the potential to do the same disrupting industries from peertopeer payments finance and the internetofthings to healthcare contracts and supply chains and there is real potential but the application is not yet there this thus creates the environment for a massive bubble everyone is free to speculate wildly because there is no way to disprove it tell me a toaster will revolutionize the automotive industry and i ll call bullshit toasterliketechnologies haven t done it so the speculation holds no water but tell me dlt will disrupt the aviation industry and make a convincing argument i can t disprove that    it s undeniable that we are in a bubble  this leads me into the following points the key attributes of every bubble  1 large scale and widespread disruption  2 very little present application  3 an asset with no underlying value   difficult to value  new theorized dlt applications will only spur more speculation eventually however the application production will truly begin challenges will arise disruption will be difficult adoption even harder the application implementation will rise dramatically but because the speculation was set so exceedingly high the application will inevitably fall short and when it becomes clear that the application will never reach the speculation the markets will correct and hard the bubble will pop   and there goes the shitcoins  we re talking internet bubble great depression first day behind the wheel crash the markets will plummet so drastically that the speculation will suddenly be far below the application it will suddenly be fundamentally undervalued it will stay there for months when from the ashes the strongest companies will begin leading the markets upwards again  but unlike many who use  bubble talk  as justification for not investing this is not my argument we re always in a bubble virtually every market is just a cycle of bubble formations and pops even the 185 trillion new york stock exchange adheres to this cycle as the speculation on the future of the us economy rises reality must eventually catch up when the market overvalues reality a bubble forms when reality fails to meet that expectation the market crashes these aren t necessarily wild 40 drops like we see in crypto but the fact remains that bubbles are simply a natural component to investing  so the real question is not are we in a bubble but rather how big will the bubble get if we respect the natural evolution of disruptive technology then we must understand that with every massive speculative runup there is an equally massive crash from the tulip bubble of the 1600s to the internet bubble only 15 years ago the crashes are inevitable thus the question is what can we learn from past bubbles and how much can they guide our actions within the cryptocurrency market   those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it  said philosopher george santayana and as peter lamborn said perhaps more aptly  those who understand history are condemned to watch other idiots repeat it   the psychological factors that lead towards enormous speculative buying are intrinsically human they unfold similarly no matter the time period no matter the asset fish gotta swim birds gotta eat and humans need to speculatively buy based on this principle we can explore other historical bubbles to understand the present cryptocurrency bubble understand the reasons understand the consequences understand the signs and you can better anticipate the trajectory be the one to pull a  big short     to be clear my argument does not revolve around bitcoin if you don t understand the difference between bitcoin and other distributed ledger technologies read this bitcoin s value is tenuous with slow and expensive transaction fees bitcoin doesn t have much functionality without functionality bitcoin s value depends heavily on people s perception of its value dlt on the other hand has serious potential applications since this article revolves around the speculation and application of cryptocurrency dlt projects are where the focus should be not on bitcoin  every technological adoption follows the same curve    the technological adoption curve  it s known as the technological adoption curve it directly relates to my earlier discussion about speculation and application the rise through the innovator early adopters and early majority phases are driven by speculation but by the time the late majority begins adopting demand for actual implementation and application becomes critical the implementation can t meet the massive speculation and the crash begins  tulips in the 1630s exploded in holland in what is today known as the dutch tulip bubble historical accounts estimate that tulip prices increased 2000 within four months before crashing by 99 in the late 1980s a massive stimulus effort by japan catapulted their economy and resulted in massive speculation from investopedia  at the peak of the real estate bubble in 1989 the value of the imperial palace grounds in tokyo was greater than that of the real estate in the entire state of california the bubble subsequently burst in early 1990  this was known as the japanese real estate and stock market bubble  but for our comparison the most relevant bubble is what s commonly known as the dotcom bubble of the 1990s and subsequent crash in 2001 2002  by the new millennium it was clear that the internet was going to change the world it began to disrupt every industry and usher in a new economy a new manner of conducting business of peertopeer connectivity sound familiar the application lived up to all speculation and then some it was likely the single most impactful most revolutionary technological development since the industrial revolution some would say even greater yet despite its groundbreaking success an enormous crash still occurred  let s rewind the clocks 22 years it s 1999 and you are a savvy investor passionate about the internet revolution the 6 biggest tech companies are valued at 165 trillion 20 of the us s gdp yet you re still constantly laughed at by your friends for investing in the new  fax machine  imbeciles you know that if you do your due diligence you will find golden dotcom companies to invest in one day one pops up on your radar it checks all your boxes strong team the two founders of borders books and powerful institutional backing sequoia capital and benchmark capital   later goldman sachs the company is webvan an online grocer that promised 30 minute deliveries in their ico in 1999 they would raise 375 million before quickly exploding to 12 billion bullish disruptive sound familiar yet in july of 2001 the stock price dropped from 30 to 6 cents and webvan lost 700 million in a day  the dotcom crash  overall 5 trillion was lost between 2000 and 2002 25 bitcoin markets gone poof only 50 of dotcoms survived the pop as a graveyard of startups lined wall street and silicon valley and sad to think the internet wasn t advanced enough to allow these people to mourn in meme form    what went wrong  in today s world of ubiquitous connectivity and seamless experience it is hard to imagine that the internet and its many applications once had difficulty cultivating a network of users but in the mid 1990s internet still had only minimal uses and yet anythingcom s began popping up everywhere putting  dot com  in your company name was enough to land you a golden ticket to ipo stardom not to mention a few hundred million  petscom webvan the examples are endless stars who burned too bright and then died the speculation grew too fast it outgrew its fundamental value it s users the speculation of what it could be was suddenly replaced by the realization of what it was in the long run speculation led to overvaluation that destroyed many companies companies need a reality check they need pressure and obstacles   a 500 million valuation directly after ipo does not lead to success  unfortunately the poorly managed were not the only ones to suffer everyone plummeted with the momentum of the crash nasdaq suffered amazon plummeted apple stock was decimated    apple stock during the crash from a high of 495 per share to 100 just nine months later    and a little perspective the arrow points to the dotcom crash  amazon crashed even more dramatically from 8506 in 1999 to 597 by 2001 when a market correction comes no one is safe  samesame but different  everyone makes the dotcom  cryptocurrency comparison both arewere driven by promising new technologies that are difficult to evaluate correctly as we said earlier bubbles are bubbles no matter the asset however the terms of the game have changed 2018 is not 2000 can we use the dotcom bubble as a viable metric is dlt s future similar to that of the internet let s explore the key differences between these two giants    the roller coaster  if the dotcom bubble was your favorite disneyland roller coaster the digital asset market is that slingshot that you ll  definitely ride one day  the blockchain market moves faster than any other market it s more volatile lifechanging gains devastating losses  blockchain is like texas and in texas everything s bigger even the losses even webvan s doomsday of 700 million daily losses don t scrape the surface of some crypto s biggest losers such as ripple s 25 billion rainy day on jan 8 this year    ripple s enormous volatility  these fluctuations are a result of several factors the access investors have to cryptocurrency and the massive availability of information via the internet this creates a perfect storm for cryptocurrency volatility additionally the plethora of exchanges both centralized and decentralized allow for crazy arbitrage and market manipulation since there are very few regulations on insider trading and market manipulating in the blockchain space one can be sure that these malicious acts are happening by the boatload a millionaire can easily affect the price of a 5 million mkt cap blockchain with 100k 24h volume whales are no strangers to these small coins and the average smalltime investor can t differentiate between these manipulations and market sentiment  worldwide  harvard s endowment isn t in digital assets your parents  retirement isn t either if it is get out the investors today aren t seasoned institutional investors they re young inexperienced speculative out to get rich quick during the 90 s nasdaq rise investments could only be made through brokers and by institutional investors with cryptocurrency anyone can participate you just need a device connected to the internet even a shepherd from pakistan can become a crypto trader what is mountain shepherding compared to the excitement of day trading    what is the btcsheep price  these investors are accessing their portfolios 247 receiving twitter updates instantaneously they don t fully understanding the technology behind their investments the internet provides market updates and information at a pace inconceivable before the internet many times this information can be highly misleading other times you re learning from outright scams as a result panic selling happens frequently fear of missing out dominates huge run ups are followed by massive crashes on a level far exceeding that of the pre2000 nasdaq   but this also means that the crypto bubble could dwarf the dotcom bubble nasdaq reached a high of 5048 trillion in march of 2000 but that high was limited by the accessibility barriers placed on investors by the difficulties encountered when sharing information quickly and on a massive scale and by the fact that dotcom investing was largely limited to north americans cryptocurrency accessible to anyone from anywhere provided they have some money and a cellphone means that as the globe begins to understand the value of dlt 5 trillion could look miniscule  but this is to simply acknowledge that predicting the top of the bubble is a fool s game instead we should focus on the identifiers that scream  warning  here are the indicators  1 mass media begins focusing not only on bitcoin which they already are but on dlt on its potential and on the associated projects this will signify that a large portion of the population is becoming aware of the underlying technology   far different than today s situation cnbc is quickly making this a reality   2 a flood of institutional money hedge funds retirement accounts personal savings this will result in a dramatic market cap increase  3 working blockchain products that are actually supporting large networks of users as we progress into this development period it will become clear that many of today s projects are failing to live up to expectations the first failed blockchain project will create a snowball effect  4 a large influx of private centralized blockchains produced by existing companies this will demonstrate that many previously predicted decentralized dlt solutions will in fact be overtaken by existing traditional companies developing their own private blockchain solutions instead of adopting decentralized token based platforms this will likely result in a large reevaluation of what the reality of blockchain actually is  5 a market cap between 5 and 10 trillion anything of that magnitude any time soon would be very worrying however it is important to understand that velocity is what creates a bubble not total marketcap a quick run up will almost always be followed by a dramatic crash  considering the fact that the public and mass media largely has no understanding of dlt supports my conclusion that we are nowhere near the top of the bubble the world is now only beginning to legitimize bitcoin it will take years before the true value of blockchain is understood by the masses in the meantime cryptocurrency will continue to progress through periods of massive volatility however the general trend will be upwards   and dramatically so   as the market progresses towards its peak and inevitably its crash  what differentiates last week s crash from the ultimate  bubble popping  crash perhaps nothing it s possible that the digital asset markets will continue to rise fall rise fall until the point that adoption brings stability it could be that last week s crash will be the most dramatic that we ever see however i think the significant difference is that during last week s crash nothing fundamental changed about the assets the crash was entirely based on speculation and market uncertainty i think the ultimate crash will occur because of some fundamental change in the underlying assets this may be a series of dlt companies that cease development because of poor management or implementation hurdles it could be that a security flaw is discovered in a number of large cap projects iota anyone regardless i think in the wake of the crash many previous blockchains will die condemned for an eternity of existence with no further development  conclusion  it s also possible that blockchain and cryptocurrency defies all predictions all historical models it s possible blockchain transforms every industry and never sees a crash such that dominated the early 2000s it s possible that blockchain and cryptocurrency rivals today s equity markets it s possible that decentralization is so dramatically different and successful that it fundamentally changes the way companies and projects develop the way humans psychologically interact with markets it s possible but i doubt it we may be playing a brave new game but we have a lot to learn from the players and games that came before us  digital assets and dlt may very well change the world but the journey is going to be bumpy    ',\n",
       " 'a useful currency should be a medium of exchange a unit of account and a store of value cryptocurrencies excel at the first but as a store of value or unit of account they re pretty bad you cannot be an effective store of value if your price fluctuates by 20 on a normal day  this is where stablecoins come in stablecoins are pricestable cryptocurrencies meaning the market price of a stablecoin is pegged to another stable asset like the us dollar  it might not be obvious why we d want this  the holy grail of crypto  bitcoin and ether are the two dominant cryptocurrencies but their prices are volatile a cryptocurrency s volatility may fuel speculation but in the long run it hinders realworld adoption  businesses and consumers don t want to be exposed to unnecessary currency risk when transacting in cryptocurrencies you can t pay someone a salary in bitcoin if the purchasing power of their wages keeps fluctuating cryptocurrency volatility also precludes blockchainbased loans derivatives prediction markets and other longerterm smart contracts that require price stability  and of course there s the long tail of users who don t want to speculate they just want a store of value on a censorshipresistant ledger escaping the local banking system currency controls or a collapsing economy right now bitcoin and ethereum can t offer them that  the idea of a pricestable cryptocurrency has been in the air for a long time much cryptocurrency innovation and adoption has been bottlenecked around pricestability for this reason building a  stablecoin  has long been considered the holy grail of the cryptocurrency ecosystem  but how does one design a stablecoin to answer that question we first have to deeply understand what it means for an asset to be pricestable  the price of stability  all stablecoins imply a peg stablecoins generally peg to the us dollar so each stablecoin trades at 1 but they sometimes peg to other major currencies or to the consumer price index  of course you can t just decide an asset should be valued at a certain price to paraphrase preston byrne a stablecoin claims to be an asset that prices itself rather than an asset that is priced by supply and demand  this goes against everything we know about how markets work  this is not to say that stablecoins are impossible stablecoins are just currency pegs and currency pegs are certainly not impossible   there are many currency pegs still being maintained however almost all large central banks have moved away from currency pegs this is in part because they ve realized pegs tend to be inflexible and difficult to maintain history has taught us again and again whether it be mexican peso crisis of 1994 the ruble crisis of 1998 or the infamous black wednesday when george soros  broke the bank of england  no currency peg can be maintained against sufficiently adverse conditions  but this is an incomplete analysis    the reality is any peg can be maintained but only within a certain band of market behavior for different pegs the band might be wider than others but it s straightforwardly true that within at least some market conditions it s possible to maintain a peg the question for each pegging mechanism is how wide is the band of behavior it can support  if you assume currency markets are performing a random walk this implies every peg will eventually walk outside of its stable band and break but the sun will also eventually swallow up the solar system so screw it   we can call a peg stable if it lasts 20 years even in fiat years that s pretty good  the question for any peg then is fourfold  1 how much volatility can this peg withstand namely downward selling pressure  2 how expensive is it to maintain the peg  3 how easy is it to analyze the band of behavior from which it can recover  4 how transparently can traders observe the true market conditions  the final two points matter a great deal because currency pegs are all about schelling points if market participants cannot identify when a peg is objectively weak it becomes easy to spread false news or incite a market panic which can trigger further selling   basically a death spiral a transparent peg is more robust to manipulation or sentiment swings  to summarize an ideal stablecoin should be able to withstand a great deal of market volatility should not be extremely costly to maintain should have easy to analyze stability parameters and should be transparent to traders and arbitrageurs these features maximize its realworld stability  these are the dimensions along which i ll analyze different stablecoin schemes  so how can you design a stablecoin  the types of stablecoins  the more stablecoin schemes i ve examined the more i ve realized how small the space of possible designs actually is most schemes are slight variations of one another and there are only a few fundamental models that actually work    at a high level the taxonomy of stablecoins includes three families fiatcollateralized coins cryptocollateralized coins and noncollateralized coins we ll analyze each in turn  fiatcollateralized stablecoins    if you want to build a stablecoin it s best to start with the obvious just create a cryptocurrency that s literally an iou redeemable for 1  you deposit dollars into a bank account and issue stablecoins 11 against those dollars when a user wants to liquidate their stablecoins back into usd you destroy their stablecoins and wire them the usd this asset should definitely trade at 1   it is less a peg than just a digital representation of a dollar  this is the simplest scheme for a stablecoin it requires centralization in that you have to trust the custodian so the custodian must be trustworthy you ll also want auditors to periodically audit the custodian which can be expensive  but with that centralization comes the greatest pricerobustness this scheme can withstand any cryptocurrency volatility because all of the collateral is held in fiat reserves and will remain intact in the event of a crypto collapse this cannot be said for any other type of stablecoin  a fiatbacked scheme is also highly regulated and constrained by legacy payment rails if you want to exit the stablecoin and get your fiat back out you ll need to wire money or mail checks   a slow and expensive process  pros   100 pricestable   simplest a big virtue   less vulnerable to hacks since no collateral is held on the blockchain  cons   centralized   need a trusted custodian to store the fiat otherwise vulnerable to brick and mortar theft   expensive and slow liquidation into fiat   highly regulated   need regular audits to ensure transparency  this is essentially what tether purports to be though they have not been recently audited and many people suspect tether is actually a fractional reserve and don t hold all of the fiat as they claim they do other stablecoins like trueusd are trying to do the same thing but with more transparency digix gold is a similar scheme except the collateral is gold instead of fiat nevertheless it shares the same fundamental properties  cryptocollateralized stablecoins    say we don t want to integrate with the traditional payment rails after all this is cryptoland we just reinvented money why go back to centralized banks and statebacked currencies  if we move away from fiat we can also remove the centralization from the stablecoin the idea falls out naturally let s do the same thing but instead of usd let s back the coin with reserves of another cryptocurrency that way everything can be on the blockchain no fiat required  but wait cryptocurrencies are unstable which means your collateral will fluctuate but a stablecoin obviously shouldn t fluctuate in value there s only one way to resolve this catch22 overcollateralize the stablecoin so it can absorb price fluctuations in the collateral  say we deposit 200 worth of ether and then issue 100 1 stablecoins against it the stablecoins are now 200 collateralized this means the price of ether can drop by 25 and our stablecoins will still be safely collateralized by 150 of ether and can still be valued at 1 each we can liquidate them now if we choose giving 100 in ether to the owner of the stablecoins and the remaining 50 in ether back to the original depositor  but why would anyone want to lock up 200 of ether to create some stablecoins there are two incentives you can use here first you could pay the issuer interest which some schemes do alternatively the issuer could choose to create the extra stablecoins as a form of leverage this is a little subtle but here s how it works if a depositor locks up 200 of ether they can create 100 of stablecoins if they use the 100 stablecoins to buy another 100 of ether they now have a leveraged position of 300 ether backed by 200 in collateral if ether goes up 2x they now have 600 instead of the 400 they d otherwise make  fundamentally all cryptocollateralized stablecoins use some variant of this scheme you overcollateralize the coin using another cryptocurrency and if the price drops enough the stablecoins get liquidated all of this can be managed by the blockchain in a decentralized way  we neglected one critical detail though the stablecoin has to know the current usdeth price but blockchains are unable to access any data from the external world so how you can you know the current price  the first way is to simply have someone continually publish a price feed onto the blockchain this is obviously vulnerable to manipulation but this may be good enough if the publisher is trustworthy the second way is to use a schelling coin scheme along the lines of truthcoin this is much more complex and requires a lot of coordination but is ultimately less centralized and less manipulable  cryptocollateralized coins are a cool idea but they have several major disadvantages cryptocollateralized coins are more vulnerable to price instability than fiatcollateralized coins they also have the very unintuitive property that they can be spontaneously destroyed  if you collateralize your coin with ether and ether crashes hard enough then your stablecoin will automatically get liquidated into ether at that point you ll be exposed to normal currency risk and ether may continue to fall this could be a dealbreaker for exchanges   in the case of a market crash they would have to deal with stablecoin balances and trading pairs suddenly mutating into the underlying crypto assets  the only way to prevent this is to overcollateralize to the hilt which makes cryptocollateralized coins much more capitalintensive than their fiat counterparts a fiatbacked cryptocurrency will require only 100k collateral to issue 100k stablecoins whereas a cryptocollateralized coin might require 200k collateral or more to issue the same number of coins  pros   more decentralized   can liquidate quickly and cheaply into underlying crypto collateral just a blockchain transaction   very transparent   easy for everyone to inspect the collateralization ratio of the stablecoin   can be used to create leverage  cons   can be autoliquidated during a price crash into underlying collateral   less price stable than fiat   tied to the health of a particular cryptocurrency or basket of cryptocurrencies   inefficient use of capital   most complexity  the first stablecoin to use this scheme was bitusd collateralized with bitshares created by dan larimer back in 2013 since then makerdao s dai is widely considered the most promising cryptocollateralized stablecoin collateralized by ether an interesting scheme proposed by vitalik buterin is using cdos to issue stablecoins against loans with different tranches of seniority the most senior tranches could act as stablecoins  noncollateralized stablecoins    as you get deeper into cryptoland eventually you have to ask the question how sure are we that we actually need collateral to begin with after all isn t a stablecoin just a coordination game arbitrageurs just have to believe that our coin will eventually trade at 1 the united states was able to move off the gold standard and is no longer backed by any underlying asset perhaps this means collateral is unnecessary and a stablecoin could adopt the same model  this idea is not completely novel   its roots can be traced to arguments made by fa hayek in the 70s a privately issued noncollateralized pricestable currency could pose a radical challenge to the dominance of fiat currencies but how would you ensure it remains stable  enter seignorage shares a scheme invented by robert sams in 2014 seignorage shares is based on a simple idea what if you model a smart contract as a central bank the smart contract s monetary policy would have only one mandate issue a currency that will trade at 1  okay but how could you ensure the currency s trading price simple   you re issuing the currency so you get to control the monetary supply  for example let s say the coin is trading at 2 this means the price is too high   or put another way the supply is too low to counteract this the smart contract can mint new coins and then auction them on the open market increasing supply until the price returns to 1 this would leave the smart contract with some extra profits historically when governments minted new money to finance their operations the profits were called the seignorage  but what if the coin is trading too low let s say it s trading at 050 you can t unissue circulating money so how can you decrease the supply there s only one way to do it buy up coins on the market to reduce the circulating supply but what if the seignorage you ve saved up is insufficient to buy up enough coins  seignorage shares says okay instead of giving out my seignorage i m going to issue shares that entitle you to future seignorage the next time i issue new coins and earn seignorage shareholders will be entitled to a share of those future profits  in other words even if the smart contract doesn t have the cash to pay me now because i expect the demand for the stablecoin to grow over time eventually it will earn more seignorage and be able to pay out all of its shareholders this allows the supply to decrease and the coin to restabilize to 1  this is the core idea behind seignorage shares and some version of this undergirds most noncollateralized stablecoins  if you think seignorage shares sounds too crazy to work you re not alone many have criticized this system for an obvious reason it resembles a pyramid scheme low coin prices are buttressed by issuing promises of future growth that growth must be subsidized by new entrants buying into the scheme fundamentally you could say that the  collateral  backing seignorage shares is shares in the future growth of the system  clearly this means that in the limit if the system doesn t eventually continue growing it will not be able to maintain its peg  perhaps that s not an unreasonable assumption though after all the monetary base for most world currencies have experienced nearly monotonic growth for the last several decades it s possible that a stable cryptocurrency might experience similar growth    but there s no free lunch in economics seignorage shares can absorb some amount of downward pressure for a time but if the selling pressure is sustained for long enough traders will lose confidence that shares will eventually pay out this will further push down the price and trigger a death spiral  the most dangerous part of this system is that it s difficult to analyze how much downward pressure can the system take how long can it withstand that pressure will whales or insiders prop up the system if it starts slipping at what point should we expect them intervene when is the point of no return when the system breaks it s hard to know and market participants are unlikely to converge this makes the system is susceptible to panics and sentimentbased swings  noncollateralized stablecoins are also vulnerable to a secular decline in demand for crypto since such a decline would inevitably inhibit growth and in the event of a crypto crash traders tend to exit to fiat currencies not stablecoins  these systems also need significant bootstrapping of liquidity early on until they can achieve healthy equilibrium but ultimately these schemes capitalize on a key insight a stablecoin is in the end a schelling point if enough people believe that the system will survive that belief can lead to a virtuous cycle that ensures its survival  with all that said noncollateralized stablecoins are the most ambitious design a noncollateralized coin is independent from all other currencies even if the us dollar and ether collapse a noncollateralized coin could survive them as a stable store of value unlike the central banks of nation states a noncollateralized stablecoin would not have perverse incentives to inflate or deflate the currency its algorithm would only have one global mandate stability  this is an exciting possibility and if it succeeds a noncollateralized stablecoin could radically change the world but if it fails that failure could be even more catastrophic as there would be no collateral to liquidate the coin back into and the coin would almost certainly crash to zero  pros   no collateral required   most decentralized and independent not tied to any other cryptocurrency or to fiat  cons   requires continual growth   most vulnerable to crypto decline or crash and cannot be liquidated in a crash   difficult to analyze safety bounds or health   some complexity  the most promising project in this category is basecoin which builds upon seignorage shares by adding a firstinfirstout  bond  queue they claim that this addition improves the stability properties of the protocol and have performed several simulations to model various outcomes  the ideal stablecoin  stablecoins are critical to the future of crypto the differences between these designs are subtle yet matter immensely  but after having looked at many of these my primary conclusion is that there is no ideal stablecoin like with most technologies the best we can do is choose the set of tradeoffs that we re willing to accept for a given application and risk profile    the best outcome then is not to try to pick winners early but rather to encourage the many stablecoin experiments to bear their fruit in the marketplace  if crypto has taught us anything it s that it s very hard to predict the future i suspect there are many more variations on these schemes waiting to be unearthed but whichever stablecoins win in the long run they ll almost certainly build on one of these fundamental designs    ',\n",
       " 'so you want to trade cryptocurrency  you ve seen those eyepopping 3000 returns and you want in  you don t want some measly little 10 roi after a year in the plain old stock market that s for grandpas and old people you want quityourjob with a middle finger fuck you money am i right or am i right  maybe you dream of being jordan belfort the wolf of wall street or gordon  greed is good

strippers  well have no fear because the buddha of wall street is here to help you with your dreams of crypto glory here s my story i was living in a oneroom apartment and sleeping in my bathtub and now i fly my helicopter to work just because i hate traffic  all of this and more can be yours  come closer and i ll tell you the ultimate supersecret ingredient to lightning fast crypto riches  are you ready  the secret ingredient is nothing  wait what  that s right  there is no secret ingredient to getting rich anyone who tells you different is selling something  oh yeah and i don t really have a helicopter yet  of course cryptocurrencies do have some of the best rois in history and you do have a shot at making some good money so let s talk about investing in cryptos the right way  i don t hide the fact that i m a longterm bull on cryptos i believe they re a game changing technology that will ripple across the entire world remaking every aspect of society like my friend chris dixon i believe bitcoin could easily be worth 100000 a coin one day although i m not quite there with perennial dennis hopper impersonator john mcafee s prediction of bitcoin going to 500k a coin at least not in the next three years it may take a little longer i ve talked about why in my articles why everyone missed the most important invention in the last 500 years and reflections on the best blockchain tweets ever written so i won t rehash those reasons again  here we re going to talk about cash money y all unlike many folks in this space trading is not my primary interest but like everyone i do enjoy making money  how do you make money with cryptocurrencies  carefully  questions questions  the very first question you need to ask yourself is do you have enough extra money to invest  what does extra money mean    surprisingly the sec has some good guidance here even though they let bernie madoff get away with a massive pyramid scheme for a decade despite someone telling them about it every year they re occasionally good for something while i m not a big fan of the nannystate accredited investor rules of the sec that let s only rich people invest as they see fit nor of the  pattern day trader  rule that requires to you to have 25000 minimum in order to day trade the traditional markets which by the way does not apply to crypto markets yet there is some merit to the rules those numbers are arbitrary bullshit but i do agree with the sentiment that led to the creation of those laws  they re trying to protect people from losing money they don t have to lose  and since the nannystate is not here to protect you in the crypto markets you will just have to go ahead and take personal responsibility and protect yourself  while stories like i invested all my spending money in ethereum and so did all my friends are funny on some level college kids can afford to take some risks because they have a lot of life left to recover later if they lose everything they re also utterly terrifying on another level what if that girl lost all her food money for the year not awesome  i can t find the tweet now but just the other day i saw a guy posting about how he mortgaged his car lost it all trading cryptos and his wife kicked him out he was looking to get in on a  shit coin pump  aka where traders get together and buy like crazy to pump a pennystock equivalent to the moon before dumping it on idiots not good do not be that guy  only invest what you can afford to lose    copyright   caglecom  if you don t have a lot of money start small don t go maxing out your credit cards or getting a  loan  from that guy your bother knows who sits on the corner outside the bodega on 156th and broadway you ll only get burned  the second question you have to ask yourself is  are you a buyandholder or a trader  these are two very very different things  by a wide margin the right strategy for most people is to just buy and hold get some well know cryptocurrencies like bitcoin ethereum dash or litecoin put them in cold storage stick them in the sock drawer and forget about them don t read the news don t worry about the wild swings or the predictions of doom from the popular press just buy hold and forget in a year or two dig them out and sell some of them and buy a little more with the proceeds wash rinse and repeat until retirement  if you want to trade however that is a different beast all together that means you re looking to get in and out of the market the rules of the game are simple  buy low sell high  duh you say  easier said than done though  there are two parts to this game   making money   keeping it  most people crash and burn on the second part everyone makes money in a bull market and then most give it right back afterwards  so does that mean you shouldn t trade no way i love trading  on the days you win it s the ultimate rush you re a viking raider swooping in on unsuspecting villagers and mowing them down with glee  on bad days though it s brutal you ll lose sleep hair friends and money you ll be depressed angry and scattered brained  so why play at all  because trading is the ultimate game  you re playing against other people with incomplete information on an occluded battlefield as well as against the maniacal and sadistic  mind  of the market and against yourself your mental strength emotions and belief systems are all working against you that business school bullshit they taught you about rational actors with perfectly distributed information making rational decisions in the marketplace is just that utter and complete bullshit  anyone who spends five fucking minutes trading knows it s crap  the markets are not rational nor are people we are fear based emotional creatures  only an ivory tower academic economist would ever think something so utterly ridiculous  first of all the information is not even close to evenly distributed we re all playing with partial information and a fog of war even worse we all have varying degrees of ability to process that information meaning all of us are kind of stupid if you re not that bright it doesn t matter how much info you have you won t be able to do shit with it go directly to dunningkruger and do not pass go  and most of us are not that bright  all of us have stupid magical belief systems and broken mental heuristics that work against us every single second of our lives    if you ask a group of people how many of them are  above average  drivers almost everyone will raise their hands this is impossible we can t all be above average but we all believe we are  even if you re a good trader you re not immune to this kind of mental insanity if you think you are that s another magical belief as i wrote this article i made not one but two stupid btc trades and busted out trying to catch today s insane 600 a coin rally late  i knew this was a terrible idea  i did it anyway  i was writing this article not focused and i was late to the party a double whammy of stupid rule number one if you miss a trade stay the hell out of the market get  em next time  but did i listen nope because i am an emotional fear based creature just like everyone else fomo fear of missing out got me the force is strong with fomo and not you or anyone else is immune to it no matter how good you get you ll regularly and repeatedly shoot yourself in the foot  when i used to trade the regular markets i can t tell you how often i saw good professional traders i m looking at you slope of hope saying  this makes no sense the market is wrong   no the market is always right  you are wrong  you re either in line with it and making money or you re losing money and bitching about how the market should be more rational  the problem is most of us are seeing a movie in our heads about life instead of what s actually right in front of our noses to the degree that reality doesn t match up with what we want to think about it we go with what we want to think about it for most humans giving up their belief systems is the same thing as death they would rather die literally than change their mind  that doesn t work for the market the markets are a lesson in humility you will learn to see things as they actually are versus how you imagine them to be or you will get taken out to the woodshed and beaten with a rubber hose in other words you will lose all your money just like that idiot who sold his car to play the markets the markets are economic darwinism and they have no mercy    let me give you an example of how your belief systems work against you in the game of coins  one of the traders i follow closely is the wolf of poloniex in full disclosure i am not a member of his  wolf pack  currently which is his paid private trading signals group i just follow the big market moves he posts about on twitter that s because in general i prefer to do my own research trust my own eyes and live with my own calls right or wrong  the wolf is a fast aggressive trader and that matches nicely with my personal style his calls regularly make me tons of money a question you have to ask of all traders is  are they right  nobody is right all the time in fact even the best of the best are wrong more than they re right the greatest traders make their money on 20 of their trades the rest of our trades make only modest gains or loses  so how can we know whether someone is right or wrong objectively  simple  either my bank account is going up or its going down  that s it  it s a perfect system binary you win or lose there is no in between  if my bank account is going up and i m following his calls closely then he s right if i keep losing money on his calls he s wrong  but most people don t see it that way lots of folks think the guy s calls are absolute shit why is that  because the wolf has an inyourface persona that rubs many people the wrong way he loves to stick it to people who say he s wrong any time he posts a call people are quick to pounce on him and call him an idiot a douchebag and a shill hucking trading calls they want him to fail  the reason is because they re unable to disconnect his calls from his persona they conflate two unrelated things whether he s likable or not is utterly irrelevant personally i like the dude but that s irrelevant too except people can t and won t see it that way    people get very attached to their opinions burn your opinions your opinions mean nothing to the market  if you thought a bull market was starting and it turns into a bear your opinion was wrong period let it go move on but people love their opinions they cling to them desperately  we re just wired that way  our brains are littered with mental pitfalls  being  right  when you re wrong is great way to lose money  do you know that at times as much as 38 of the population can t tell you which party is more conservative in america 38 in fact most people don t vote based on actual politics at all they pick who they like the most and then project their viewpoints onto that person even if that person has diametrically opposed ideas to their own  how fucking stupid is that  welcome to the human race  we re prone to all kinds of crazyass mental nonsense  so with that kind of broken grey matter how the hell can we expect to get good at trading  is there any hope  yes  getting good at trading  to start with you better start reading  we all have a lot to learn and the sooner we start doing it the better we get your goal is to learn something every day for the rest of your life    my current favorite book on trading is the super simple top 10 trading setups how to find them when to trade them how to make money with them like all trading books i prefer the paper copy as opposed to the kindle edition as the chart pictures are easier to see  this book is short and to the point there are no stories of the author s trading glory or links to his special ultra secret system that you can have for a mere thousand dollars more it concentrates on simple practical advise for multiple market trends everyone makes money when it s all going up but how do you deal with trades going sideways or down it s in there  while the book is focused on traditional markets most of the rules he puts forward can easily be applied to the crypto markets his reasons for why new traders lose money on the very first page is worth the price of the entire book  new traders lose because they   trade too big   trade without an edge or in other words   gamble   over trade   trade low price junk stocks   use excessive leverage  trading with leverage in the cryptos is like juggling cobras don t fucking do it if you re not a professional trader the crypto markets move too fast and you can easily lose someone else s money that you don t have to pay back not good  that brings us to the one major difference between the regular and the crypto markets  crypto markets move at video game speed    when he talks about how a market might take weeks or months to play out in the parallel universe of crypto trading that could play out in days we literally just saw the market crash out 40 going full bear and then recover in two days to new heights that s how fast it moves  this is one of the reasons the popular press does not understand cryptos they regularly report that bitcoin is over and dead for good it s hilarious check out this article from 99 bitcoins someone writes bitcoin s obituary every day  the problem is the poppress is used to playing the game at slower speeds it s as if they were good football players in college only to go to the pros and have guys blow right past them it s a totally different level this is the esports universe  cryptos are the computer generation s stock market  it s run by kids who never lived life without the internet to them it s just like a tree it was always there the nyse come from the days of ink and wood pulp when forbes or cnn or fox reports on bear markets in the traditional stock world they re usually right for a reasonable period that market will go cold for months in crypto it could go nova hot tomorrow  it s warp speed  to keep up your need an edge that brings us to book number two    encyclopedia of chart patterns  this book is a monster it s heavy and dense and filled with information after reading it you ll likely start seeing patterns everywhere even when they don t exist don t worry study them anyway you ll regularly see people drawing random lines on the chart on twitter and calling it  technical analysis  but this book is much more disciplined and serious  technical analysis aka studying the chart patterns works pretty damn well in crypto trading my gut tells me it s because most of the folks trading cryptos are geeks and we re prone to liking ta because it makes sense to the engineer brain that makes them a selffulfilling prophesy it also works because there s lots of machine trading going on you ll be trading against bots regularly on the exchanges and they have no choice but to make decisions based on moving averages pull backs breakouts and all the other things that ta aficionados love  the other reason it works is because ta is all about psychology people want to take gains and cut losses after a certain amount of rise it s going to fall it s just natural  the markets are really nothing but the shared hallucination of our collective unconscious the projection of our hopes dreams and fears  remember though ta is not a magic eight ball  it does not work all the time it s often just junk voodoo it s hard to do right easy to do wrong and prone to all kinds of false signals still it s a useful tool it s saved me a number of times and helped me avoid big crashes    the last book on my list is one i ve always loved one up on wall street by legendary investor peter lynch yeah that lynch the one with his name on the marquee he beat the market for fifteen years statistically most traders bust out after ten years a lot of the advice in the book like making sure you buy a home before investing in stocks is outdated homes are regularly a huge money pit of debt for today s young people but his investing advice is timeless and applies to any market  how did he make his mulah like warren buffet he focused on  value investing  what s that you ask excellent question young padawan  he invested in what he knew and understood when his wife or kids came home with a shopping bag from a new store he d research that company and buy it he figured if people were buying from it it was a good company  investing in what you know is a great mental heuristic warren buffet regularly refuses to invest in all kinds of companies like the tech stars everyone loves because he doesn t understand tech because he doesn t understand it he can t make a good call ahead of time so he stays out if you don t understand the purpose of a coin stay out don t buy it because it s going to the moon and some jackass in a slack forum told you it s killer  in crypto value investing means not buying a bunch of shit coins icos happen all the time and new coins pop onto the market promising great returns some of them will deliver one day but most of those coins will go to nothing in the next few years  personally i tend to invest in  infrastructure  coins or coins that have a chance to be multifaceted and serve lots of purposes i have a background in building systems because i was a systems administrator for more than a decade i m looking for the folks building the railroad tracks of tomorrow  ethereum bitcoin qtum and tezos have multiple purposes pot coin does not  over the years like all good traders peter lynch made all his money on 20 of his  home run  trades and lost or made modest returns on 80 of his trades  8020 is the formula  you will never do better than that even if you manage it for a number of years eventually you ll revert to the mean that s statistics baby and math is god it runs things around here and everywhere else  and of course even after you read all these books try to remember  there is no secret ingredient  actually there is  the secret ingredient is you  it s cheesy but it s true  the way to get better is to get in the game there is no substitute for personal experience there s an old saying in the ancient game of go    attack and defense   to learn go first lose 100 games fast   this is true of everything in life  you have to get into the arena you ve got to play the game without skin in the game you won t learn a damn thing  it s one thing to read about something in a book and another thing entirely to do it  when the pressure is on and your emotions are against you and you re watching thousands of dollars vaporizing in minutes and you re fighting with your significant other and absurdly blaming her for taking you to dinner and  causing  you to lose money magical belief because you weren t watching the trading screen like a hawk then you ll understand  this ain t no joke  this is not hypothetical this happened to me last week  but every day i learn  oh and i did make money i was just mad i didn t make more that s when i knew i needed to take a break and do nothing for a day i got up late took a walk ate a nice breakfast and apologized for being a jerk to my beautiful lady  you have to recharge you don t need to catch every damn run go out see the trees listen to the birds play with your kids and your pets in short do the things that matter in life the markets will be waiting for you when you return  here s the deal you ll make mistakes and you ll learn that s the only way    tr got in the arena and you should too  but if you let this amazing and legendary quote by the great teddy roosevelt be your guide to trading and to life and if you re lucky you just might do ok in the world   it is not the critic who counts not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles or where the doer of deeds could have done them better the credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood who strives valiantly who errs who comes short again and again because there is no effort without error and shortcoming but who does actually strive to do the deeds who knows great enthusiasms the great devotions who spends himself in a worthy cause who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement and who at the worst if he fails at least fails while daring greatly so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat     ',\n",
       " 'for those new to the blog i am the lead developer of sia a blockchain based cloud storage platform about a year ago myself and some members of the sia team started obelisk a cryptocurrency asic manufacturing company our first asics are going to ship in about 8 weeks and our journey with obelisk has given us a lot of insight into the world of cryptocurrency mining  one of the reasons we started obelisk was because we felt that coin devs in general had a very poor view into the mining world and that the best way to understand it would be to get our hands dirty and bring a miner to market  since starting obelisk we ve learned a lot about the mining space as relevant to gpus to asics to fpgas to asic resistance mining farms electricity and to a whole host of other subjects that coin developers should be more aware of we aren t able to share everything that we know but we ve pulled together information on a set of key topics that i think will be helpful to cryptocurrency designers and other members of the cryptocurrency community    asic resistance  we ve been pessimistic on asic resistance for a long time and our journey into the hardware world solidly confirmed our position hardware is extremely flexible general purpose computational devices like cpus gpus and even dram all make substantial compromises to their true potential in order to be useful for general computation for basic hardware development most algorithms can see substantial optimization just by taking away all of that generality and focusing on one specific thing  the vast majority of asicresistant algorithms were designed by software engineers making assumptions about the limitations of custom hardware these assumptions tend to be incorrect  equihash is perhaps the easiest target as a lot of people were quite confident in the equihash algorithm and we ve been saying for close to a year that we know how to make very effective equihash asics  the key is to make sorting memory a lot of algorithm designers don t seem to realize that in an asic you can merge the computational and storage pieces of a chip when a gpu does equihash computations it has to go all the way out to offchip memory bring data to the computational cores manipulate the data and then send the altered data all the way back out to the offchip memory  for equihash the manipulations that you need to make to the data are simple enough that you can just merge the memory and computation together meaning that you can do most of your manipulating inplace substantially reducing the amount of energy used to move data back and forth and also substantially decreasing the amount of time between adjustments to the data this greatly increases efficiency and speed  needless to say we weren t the least bit surprised when bitmain released powerful asics for equihash the bitmain asics are actually substantially less performant 5x to 10x than our own internal study suggested they would be there could be many reasons for this but overall we think that it s pretty reasonable to assume that more powerful equihash asics will be released in the coming months  we also had loose designs for ethash ethereum s algorithm admittedly ethash was not as easily amenable to asics as equihash but as we ve seen from products on the market today you can still do well enough to obsolete gpus ethash is by far the most asic resistant algorithm we ve looked at most of the others have shortcuts that are even more significant than the shortcuts you can take with equihash  at the end of the day you will always be able to create custom hardware that can outperform general purpose hardware i can t stress enough that everyone i ve talked to in favor of asic resistance has consistently and substantially underestimated the flexibility that hardware engineers have to design around specific problems even under a constrained budget for any algorithm there will always be a path that custom hardware engineers can take to beat out general purpose hardware it s a fundamental limitation of general purpose hardware    hardfork resistance  a lot of people believe that computing is broken up into 3 categories cpu gpu and asic while those are the categories that are generally visible to the public in the chip world there s really only one type of chip an asic internally nvidia intel and other companies refer to their products as asics the categories as known to the public are really a statement about how flexible the asic is  i would like to use a 1 to 10 scale to measure flexibility at one side a  1  we ll put an intel cpu and at the other side a  10  we ll put a bitcoin asic designers have the ability to create chips that fall anywhere on this scale as you move from a  1  to a  10  you lose substantial flexibility but gain substantial performance you also decrease the amount of design and development effort required as you sacrifice flexibility on this scale a gpu is a  2   generally speaking we don t see products developed that fall anywhere between a gpu and a fully inflexibile asic because typically by the time you ve given up enough flexibility to move away from a gpu you ve only got a very specific application in mind and you are willing to sacrifice every last bit of flexibility to maximize performance it s also a lot less costly to design fully inflexible asics which is another reason you don t see too many things in the middle  two examples of products between a gpu and an asic would be the baikal miners and the google tpu these are chips which can cover a flexible range of applications at performances which are substantially better than a gpu the baikal case specifically is interesting because it s good enough to obsolete gpus for a large number of coins all using the same basic chip these chips appear to be flexible enough to follow hardforks as well  the strategy of hardforking asics off of a network is going to lose potency the more it happens because chip designers do have the ability to make chips that are flexible anywhere from slightly flexible to highly flexible with each piece of flexibility costing only a bit of performance the monero devs have committed to keeping the same general structure for the pow algorithm and because of that commitment we believe that you could make a monero miner capable of surviving hard forks with less than a 5x hit to performance  equihash is an algorithm that has three parameters zcash mining happens with one particular choice for these parameters and any naive hardfork from zcash to drop asics would likely involve changing one or more of these parameters we were able to come up with a basic architecture for equiahsh asics that would be able to successfully follow a hardfork that chose any set of parameters meaning a basic hardfork tweaking the algorithm parameters would not be enough to disrupt our chip a more fundamental change would be needed despite this flexibility we believe our asic would be able to see massive speedups and efficiency gains over gpus we never found funding for the equihash asics and as a result our designs ended up on the shelf  the ultimate conclusion here once again wraps back to the capabilities of asics i think there are a lot of people out there who do not realize that flexible asics are possible and expected that routinely doing small hardforks to disrupt any asics on the network would be sufficient it may be sufficient sometimes but just as algorithms can attempt to be asic resistant asics can attempt to be hardfork resistant especially when the changes are more minor    monero s secret asics  a few months ago it was publicly exposed that asics had been developed in secret to mine monero my sources say that they had been mining on these secret asics since early 2017 and got almost a full year of secret mining in before discovery the roi on those secret asics was massive and gave the group more than enough money to try again with other asic resistant coins  it s estimated that monero s secret asics made up more than 50 of the hashrate for almost a full year before discovery and during that time nobody noticed during that time a huge fraction of the monero issuance was centralizing into the hands of a small group and a 51 attack could have been executed at any time  monero s hardfork appears to have been successful in shaking the asics i don t believe that the asic designers attempted to build flexibility into their asics but now that monero has announced a twiceannual pow change we may see another round of secret asics with more flexibility the block reward for monero is high enough that even if you think you have only a 30 chance of your asic surviving the pow hardfork it s more than worthwhile to pursue a hardfork resistant asic  my strong guess is that monero is going to have another round of secret asics built and that these asics will be more conservative and flexible attempting to follow the hard forks that monero puts out every 6 months    other secret asics  we ve heard rumors of plenty of other secret asics people who own secret asics tend not to talk about them very much but as of march 2018 we had heard of secret asic rumors specifically for both equihash and ethash and then for many other smaller coins that don t have any asics on them yet we believe a full 3 different groups were actively mining on zcash with different asics prior to the bitmain z9 announcement  we know of mining farms that are willing to pay millions of dollars for exclusive access to designs for specific cryptocurrencies even low ranking cryptocurrencies have the potential to make millions in profits for someone with exclusive access to secret asics as a result an informal underground industry has been set up around secret mining the heavy amount of secrecy involved means it s disconnected and mostly operates off of rumor and previous relationships but it s nonetheless a very lucrative industry and even when things happen like the vertcoin hardfork the setback to secret miners is dwarfed by the returns of the successes  at this point i think it s safe to assume that every proofofwork coin with a block reward of more than 20 million in the past year has at least one group of secret asics currently mining on it or will have secret asics mining on it within a few months the easiest way to detect this is gpu returns however as asics continue to infiltrate every coin on the market that will cease to be a reliable metric as there will be no gpuonly coin to use as a baseline at least not one that is large enough to sustain all of the massive gpu farms that are out there  the asic game has become such an advanced game because there is so much money on the table even small coins can be worth tens of millions of dollars which is more than enough to justify a highrisk production run    manufacturer exposure  manufacturers that sell asics to the public like bitmain tend to be less exposed than consumers to things like asic hardforks using sia as an example we estimate it cost bitmain less than 10 million to bring the a3 to market within 8 minutes of announcing the a3 bitmain already had more than 20 million in sales for the hardware they spent 10 million designing and manufacturing before any of the miners had made any returns for customers bitmain had recovered their full initial investment and more  in this case a hardfork doesn t hurt bitmain bitmain made a profit off of sia and there s nothing the developers can do about that and it seems that was the case for the monero miners that bitmain announced as well bitmain didn t even get to announce the miners until after monero announced their hardfork and still it seems that they sold enough obsolete hardware to customers to make back their costs and turn a hearty profit  the mining game is weighted heavily in favor of the manufacturers they get to control the hardware production the supply and they know more about the state of the industry than anyone else the profitability of a miner largely depends on variables that the manufacturer controls without disclosure to anyone else  in the case of halong s decred miner we saw them  sell out  of an unknown batch size of 10000 miners after that it was observed that more than 50 of the mining rewards were collecting into a single address that was known to be associated with halong meaning that they did keep the majority of the hashrate and profits to themselves our investigation into the mining equipment strongly suggests to us that the total manufacturing cost of the equipment is less than 1000 meaning that anyone who paid 10000 for it was paying a massive profit premium to the manufacturer giving them the ability to make 9 more units for themselves beyond this the buyer has no idea how many were sold nor where the difficulty would be when the units shipped the manufacturer does know whether or not the buyer is going to be able to make a return but the buyer does not the buyer is trusting the manufacturer entirely  if a cryptocurrency like sia has a monthly block reward of 10 million and a batch of miners is expected to have a shelf life of 120 million the most you would expect a company could make off of building miners is 120 million but manufacturers actually have a way to make substantially more than that  in the case of bitmain s a3 a small batch of miners were sold to the public with a very fast shipping time less than 10 days shortly afterwards youtube videos started circulating of people who had bought the miners and were legitimately making 800 per day off of their miner this created a lot of mania around the a3 setting bitmain up for a very successful batch 2  while we don t know exactly how many a3 units got sold we suspect that the profit margins they made on their batch 2 sales are greater than the potential block reward from mining using the a3 units that is to say bitmain sold over a hundred million dollars in mining rigs knowing that the block reward was not large enough for their customers to make back that money even assuming free electricity and this isn t the first time they pulled something similar with the dash miners we call it flooding and it s another example of the dangerous asymmetry that exists between manufacturers and customers  at the end of the day cryptocurrency miner manufacturers are selling money printing machines a wellfunded profit maximizing entity is only going to sell a money printing machine for more money than they expect they could get it to print themselves the buyer needs to understand why the manufacturer is selling the units instead of keeping them for themselves  there are a few reasons it would make sense for a manufacturer to sell a money printing machine rather than keep it the first is capital   manufacturing is an expensive process with a lot of lead times if the manufacturer doesn t have enough money to build their own units then it makes sense to sell the units instead and use the money from sales for production it boils down to the manufacturer selling future revenue to get revenue today which is a very common transaction in the financial world  another reason the manufacturer may sell money printing machines instead of running them is the electricity costs of running them if the manufacturer can only get a certain deal on electricity then there may be someone else with cheaper electricity or better datacenters who would be willing to buy the units at a price that s higher than what the manufacturer values them at most manufacturers however have access to good electricity deals and unless you have some deal with free electricity or are otherwise running a cutting edge professional operation you are not likely to do better than the manufacturer  and finally the manufacturer may have some other reason that they want money quickly instead of making a longer term investment into the hardware themselves this is likely not the case in cryptocurrency mining though because the shelf life of miners tends to be under two years and to a business that s not a long time at all to wait for healthy returns    manufacturer agility  in the traditional chip development world it takes about 2 years to go from launching a development effort to getting a chip out out the door in the case of the sia and decred miners we built it looks like we re going to be at about 13 months total from project launch to product delivery if we had to do the same thing again i think we could do it in about 9 months  a huge portion of the time spent is on fullcustom routing for the chip there s a much faster development process called placeandroute which trims about 3 months off of the chip development time but produces chips that are 2x5x slower than what a fullcustom team can produce we think that if we used a placeandroute design methodology we could get our product delivery timeline close to 6 months  we believe it took bitmain about 5 months to create the a3 miner and we believe it took halong about 9 months to create the b52 miner we suspect both of these were completed using placeandroute methodologies especially given the relatively poor performance of each  those are timelines for creating a chip from scratch if the goal is to chase a hardfork the timelines are a lot shorter if you know in advance that you are going to need to redesign your chip there are a lot of shortcuts you can take to reduce the overall time required to get to market changing a design to meet a tweak is going to take much less time than starting from scratch a good team with a wellplanned base architecture can probably complete designs in about 2 weeks from there with some help from a hotlot you can get a new set of chips in about 40 days these then need to be packaged which is going to take around a week and then sent to the manufacturer for assembly finally you have to get the units to a datacenter and start mining  if you had all the wafers parts and everything reserved ahead of time we believe that you could upgrade a chip to adapt to a hardfork and have miners mining on the new hashing algorithm in about 70 days at least in theory in practice bitmain would probably require 3 4 months to adapt an existing chip to a hard fork and if they hadn t reserved wafers in advance they d be looking at 4 5 months any company that is not bitmain can probably add another 30 60 days to these numbers    economies of scale  some people already understand the situation with economies of scale well the more money you spend the more effective each dollar is this effect is maintained throughout every level of scale that i ve been able to peer into including scales where you are going from billions of dollars to tens of billions of dollars  the most simple way that this manifests is in volume orders if you order one hundred thousand heatsinks you can get one price if you order one million heatsinks you get a better price as you continue to scale up the price falls off this effect is in place for almost all parts in the hardware industry and it happens because manufacturers get to the point where they can buy and dedicate equipment to your order and then keep that equipment at 100 efficiency as you scale up you gain greater customization and specialization in addition to cost savings meaning your products become more effective as well as cheaper  at some point it makes sense just to buy out all the capacity at the manufacturer a huge component of manufacturing price is paying for equipment equipment that is idle 50 of the time is going to have 2x the effective perpart price than equipment that is in use 100 of the time as you increase lead times and order volumes you can start getting fully dedicated equipment running nonstop for you which again pulls the price down substantially  in a similar sort of turn someone has to manufacture that equipment if you scale up to the point where you are continuously ordering specific equipment the manufacturer can start to dedicate pipelines to you and keep their own equipment operating 100 of the time and so the equipment you use for manufacturing is getting cheaper now on top of being in use all the time  and that s just the beginning at every step each provider manufacturer etc is going to be taking margins typically somewhere around 30 depending on how commodity your orders are if you have enough money you can start to engage in vertical integration cutting out the margins of your manufacturers by either buying them out or creating your own marginfree entity  hardware goes through a lot of steps there s the acquisition of raw materials like iron and oil the refinement of these materials and then they get manufactured into base parts that can be sold for more general products those base parts often have lead times that are 6 months which means that suppliers typically keep a huge number of them in stock so that they can provide customers with parts on faster timelines every step typically introduces both a middleman and inefficiency especially because each step is targeted towards general use parts instead of a specific product if you have a specific product that has enough volume  scale to justify dedicated supply chain elements you will shave costs you will shave lead times you will improve product quality and performance and you will get ahead of what anyone without that type of scale can achieve  to present a very rough number it seems to me that every time you 10x the amount of money you are spending you can save about 30 per part that is to say if you are spending 100 million on mining units you might get units for 500 each and if you are spending 1 billion on mining units you can squeeze that price down to 350 per miner just by having more money to throw around and then if you jump to 10 billion your perminer price might drop to 245 your mining machines aren t just getting cheaper though they are also becoming more customized and higher performance you don t just build a dollar moat with scale you also build a quality moat    playing dirty  when we started obelisk we had numerous separate sources reach out and warn us that bitmain plays dirty and that if we try to manufacture in china we will be stopped  with that in mind we brought up the issue to everyone we worked with and proceeded cautiously with an american manufacturer that owned a facility in china this was attractive because the prices were close to half of what we would have paid to manufacture in america and manufacturing was going to be one of our largest expenses by far  we did everything we could to keep the entity disconnected from obelisk and we hid the name of the manufacturer from our website or any public data and we were very careful with who we gave the name of our manufacturer privately we had a separate entity put in parts orders where we could  after any reasonable timeframe to reach out to another manufacturer afterhours on a friday night our manufacturer reached out to us and said with little warning or reasonable explanation that they would be unable to manufacture for us just as we had been warned our attempt to manufacture in china had fallen flat on its face this setback is estimated to have cost us somewhere north of 2 million  we have absolutely no evidence that bitmain was involved in any way we ve had other companies reach out to us and confirm that they ve experienced similar things but they too had no concrete evidence that bitmain was involved in any way i honestly was not sure whether to include this section in the blog post because unlike most of the other things i ve been saying we really have nothing more than a bunch of warnings that ended up being correct to inform us  but it s well established in the industry that bitmain plays dirty and it s been suggested to us from all sides that they have been and will continue making moves within our supply chain to ensure we can t succeed and that they do the same with all of their competitors  mining farms  mining farms are perhaps the one area where manufacturers and economies of scale are not dominant good electricity deals tend to come in smaller packages tend to be distributed around the world and tend to be difficult to find and each involve unique circumstances as such it s been difficult for larger companies to create a system for scooping up low cost electricity worldwide instead the cheapest electricity and datacenters in the world tend to be held by smaller parties that don t individually own all that much electricity or hashrate  from what i ve been able to dig up the average professional mining farm is paying somewhere between 4 and 6 cents for electricity and then another 3 to 6 cents for management and maintenance a total cost of 50 per kilowatt per month is probably somewhere close to the median for large scale mining farms as techniques improve and the industry grows we expect this number to fall closer to 35 per kilowatt per month including maintenance land taxes etc throughout 2019 and 2020 we don t believe that anyone paying more than 80 per kilowatt per month will be able to remain competitive unless the price of cryptocurrency continues to rise rapidly over the next year  the top 20 of miners all seem to be below 35 per kilowatt per month already from what we ve been able to glean and the top 5 seem to be below 20 per kilowatt per month by my estimation if the price of bitcoin were to fall substantially these mining operations would be able to stay in business and everyone paying 50 or more would be forced to shut down their facilities  it s really hard to know where bitmain is at but based on everything we ve been seeing we estimate that bitmain is somewhere around the 30 per kilowatt per month mark that is they are doing better than the median mining operation but by no means are they in the elite tier    the chip is not important  most mining startups seem incredibly focused around the chip itself from what we ve seen the chip is really less than half the story so the chip is important apologies for the title but if all you ve got is the best chip in the world you aren t going to be a competitive manufacturer  as a miner the goal at the end of the day is to do as many hashes as possible for as little money as possible a faster chip means that you need to spend less money on chips to get hashrate and a more energy efficient chip means you need to spend less money on electricity to get hashrate but you aren t just spending money on chips and electricity you spend money on pcb on controllers on ports like ethernet ports on power supplies and power management on fans on enclosures on shelves in your datacenter etc  at the end of the day the chip is only a portion of the equation for mining successfully if you aren t thinking about the whole picture you are going to end up with a chip that will lose you money this is actually one of the things that killed butterfly labs among many   they designed a high performance chip that produced hundreds of watts of heat by comparison bitmain chips are typically about six watts each where bitmain is able to throw on a forest of fat heatsinks butterfly labs had to struggle with expensive cutting edge unreliable cooling systems and that ultimately meant their powerhouse chip was late to market and too expensive to operate  bitmain is impressive  people tend to underestimate bitmain yes they have the most money and yes they dominate because of their economies of scale but they also dominate because they ve got the fastest tomarket time of any company they dominate because they ve got the best chip developers in cryptocurrency they dominate because they ve innovated in dozens of places to squeeze costs and inefficiencies out of corners that most people aren t aware exist they hire the best people and pay them well and they work hard to make sure that at every iteration they are the ones on top  there s not a whole lot more to say here i feel that a lot of people underestimate bitmain or assume that because they play dirty they wouldn t be able to keep up without playing dirty but that s not true they play dirty because it s yet another place they can optimize their business and because they know they can get away with it everything else they do is highly optimized as well if we want to understand mining we need to appreciate that the entity that controls most of mining today is an impressive highly skilled well refined entity    conclusion  the biggest takeaway from all of this is that mining is for big players the more money you spend the more of an advantage you have and there s not an easy way to change that equation at least with traditional nakamoto style consensus a large entity that produces and controls most of the hashrate seems to be more or less the outcome and at the very best you get into a situation where there are 2 or 3 major players that are all on similar footing but i don t think at any point in the next few decades will we see a situation where many manufacturing companies are all producing relatively competitive miners manufacturing just inherently leads to centralization and it happens across many different vectors  though that s discouraging news it s not the end of the world for bitcoin or other proof of work based cryptocurrencies decentralization of hashrate is a goodtohave but there are a large number of other incentives and mechanisms at play that keep monopoly manufacturers in line a great example of this is the bitcoin  segwit2x situation more than 80 of the hashrate was openly in support of activating segwit2x and yet the motion as a whole failed  there are plenty of other tools available to cryptocurrency developers and communities as well to deal with a hostile hashrate base including hardforks and community splits the hashrate owners know this and as a result they are careful not to do anything that would cause a revolt or threaten their healthy profit streams and now that we know to expect a largely centralized hashrate we can continue as developers and inventors to work on structures and schemes which are secure even when the hashrate is all pooled into a small number of places    ',\n",
       " 'there s one incredible feature of cryptocurrencies that almost everyone seems to have missed including satoshi himself  but it s there hidden away steadily gathering power like a hurricane far out to sea that s sweeping towards the shore  it s a stealth feature one that hasn t activated yet  but when it does it will ripple across the entire world remaking every aspect of society  to understand why you just have to understand a little about the history of money  the ascent of money  money is power  nobody knew this better than the kings of the ancient world that s why they gave themselves an absolute monopoly on minting moolah  they turned shiny metal into coins paid their soldiers and their soldiers bought things at local stores the king then sent their soldiers to the merchants with a simple message   pay your taxes in this coin or we ll kill you     that s almost the entire history of money in one paragraph coercion and control of the supply with violence aka the  violence hack  the one hack to rule them all  when power passed from monarchs to nationstates distributing power from one strongman to a small group of strongmen the power to print money passed to the state anyone who tried to create their own money got crushed  the reason is simple  centralized enemies are easy to destroy with a  decapitation attack  cut off the head of the snake and that s the end of anyone who would dare challenge the power of the state and its divine right to create coins  that s what happened to egold in 2008 one of the first attempts to create an alternative currency launched in 1996 by 2004 it had over a million accounts and at its peak in 2008 it was processing over 2 billion dollars worth of transactions  the us government attacked the four leaders of the system bringing charges against them for money laundering and running an  unlicensed money transmitting  business in the case  united states of america v egold ltd et al  it destroyed the company by bankrupting the founders even with light sentences for the ring leaders it was game over although the government didn t technically shut down egold practically it was finished  unlicensed  is the key word in their attack  the power to grant a license is monopoly power  egold was free to apply for interstate money transmitting licenses  it s just they were never going to get them  and of course that put them out of business it s a living breathing catch22 and it works every time  kings and nation states know the real golden rule  control the money and you control the world  and so it s gone for thousands and thousands of years the very first emperor of china qin shi huang 260 210 bc abolished all other forms of local currency and introduced a uniform copper coin that s been the blueprint ever since eradicate alternative coins create one coin to rule them all and use brutality and blood to keep that power at all costs  in the end every system is vulnerable to violence  well almost every one  the hydra  in decentralized systems there is no head of the snake decentralized systems are a hydra cut off one head and two more popin to take its place    in 2008 an anonymous programmer working in secret figured out the solution to the violence hack once and for all when he wrote  governments are good at cutting off the heads of centrally controlled networks like napster but pure p2p networks like gnutella and tor seem to be holding their own   and the first decentralized system of money was born  bitcoin  it was explicitly designed to resist coercion and control by centralized powers  satoshi wisely remained anonymous for that very reason he knew they would come after him because he was the symbolic head of bitcoin  that s what s happened every time someone has come forward claiming to be satoshi or when someone has been  outed  by the news media as bitcoin s mysterious creator when fake satoshi craig wright came out australian authorities immediately raided his house the official reason is always spurious the real reason is to cut off the head of the snake  as bitcoin rises in value the hunt for satoshi will only intensify he controls at least a million coins that have never moved from his original wallets if vc chris dixon is right and bitcoin rocket to 100000 a coin those million coins will shoot up to 100 billion if it goes even higher say a 1 million a coin that would make him the world s first trillionaire and that will only bring the hammer down harder and faster on him you can be 100 sure that black ops units would be gunning for him around the clock  wherever he is my advice to satoshi is this  stay anonymous until your death bed  but resistance to censorship and violence are only one of a number of incredible features of bitcoin many of those key components are already at work in a number of other cryptocurrencies and decentralized app projects most notably blockchains  blockchains are distributed ledgers the third entry in the world s first tripleentry accounting system and breakthroughs in accounting have always presaged a massive uptick in human complexity and economic growth as i laid out in my article why everyone missed the most important invention in the last 500 years  but even tripleentry accounting decentralization and resistance to the violence hack are not the true power of cryptocurrencies those are merely the mechanisms of the system the way it survives and thrives bringing new capabilities to the human race  the ultimate feature is one that bitcoin and current cryptocurrencies have only hinted at so far a latent feature  the true power of cryptocurrencies is the power to print and distribute money without a central power  maybe that seems obvious but i assure you it s not especially the second part  that power has always rested with the divine right of kings and nationstates  until now  now that right returns to its rightful owners the people  and that will blow open the doors of world commerce sowing the seeds for star trek like abundance economics leaving the old world order of pure scarcity economics in the pages of history books  there s just one problem  nobody has created the cryptocurrency we actually need just yet  you see satoshi understood the first part of the maxim the power to print money what he missed was the power to distribute that money  the second part is actually the most crucial part of the puzzle missing it created a critical flaw in the bitcoin ecosystem instead of distributing the money far and wide it traded central bankers for an unelected group of miners  these miners play havoc with the system holding back much needed software upgrades like segwit for years and threatening pointless hard forks in order to drive down the price with fud and scoop up more coins at a depressed price  but what if there was a different way  what if you could design a system that would completely alter the economic landscape of the world forever  the key is how you distribute the money at the moment of creation  and the first group to recognize this opportunity and put it into action will change the world  to understand why you have to look at how money is created and pushed out into the system today  the great pyramid  today money starts at the top and flows down to everyone else think of it as a pyramid    in fact we have a famous pyramid with a third eye on the dollar itself  one of the most cliched arguments against bitcoin is that it s a ponzi or  pyramid  scheme a pyramid scheme rests on the original creators of the system roping in as many suckers as possible paying them for enrolling people in the system rather than by offering goods and services eventually you run out of people to bring in and the whole things collapses like a house of cards a ponzi scheme is basically the same in that you dupe the original investors with fake returns on their initial investment a la bernie madoff and then get them to rope in more suckers because they re so elated by the huge returns    the irony of course is that fiat currency ie government printed money like the yen or us dollar is closer to a pyramid scheme than bitcoin why because fiat money is minted at the top of the pyramid by central banks and then  trickled down  to everyone else  the only problem is it doesn t trickle down all that well  it moves out to a few big banks who either lend it to people or give it to people for their labor in fact having a job or getting a loan are the primary methods that people at the bottom of the pyramid get any of the money in other words they trade their current time with a job or their future time with a loan for that money it s just that their time is a limited resource and they can only trade so much of it before it runs out  think of economics as a game everyone in the system is a player looking to maximize their advantage and the advantage of their team a company their family and friends etc to get more of the money but to start the game you need to initially distribute the money or nobody can play distributing money sets the playing field  now if you were in charge of the money how would you distribute it to the network you d want to keep as much of it for yourself as possible so you d set the rules to maximize your own personal advantage of course you would that s what anyone in their right mind would do maximize their own power to keep it for as long as possible    that s precisely what the kings and queens of the ancient world did and that s what nation states do today as naval ravikant said in his epic series of tweets on blockchain today s networks are run by  kings corporations aristocracies and mobs   and the rulers of these networks are the most powerful people in society   that s why every single system in the history of the world has distributed the money in one way  from the top down  because it maximizes the advantage of the kings and mobs at the top  unfortunately that means most of the money never really leaves the top it stays right there as wasted and frozen potential that s never realized there is little to no incentive for the money to move since money is power hoarding it is literally hoarding more power and nobody would willingly give up that power  in other words the game is rigged  what we need is a way to reset the game  up until now our prospects looked very dim  for example we could pass a law like a universal basic income ubi that would give everyone a stream of money pushing it out across the entire playing field and giving more people a chance to participate in the system if more people can participate we unlock all kinds of hidden and untapped value  how many great inventors never managed to create their next breakthrough because they were stuck driving a bus seven days a week to feed their family with no hope of free time or any clear path to digging themselves out of debt how many great writers went to their graves never having written their great novel how many budding scientists never discovered the cure to cancer or heart disease  the problem with all of the plans before now from ubi to socialism high taxes on the rich to spread the wealth across the game is that to redistribute the money after it s already been distributed is nearly impossible the people with that money rightfully resist its redistribution and as margret thatcher said  the trouble with socialism is that eventually you run out of other people s money   but what if the money is not already distributed  what if we don t have to take it from anyone at all    the inevitable outcome of all fractional reserve lending booms is bust  that s the missed opportunity of all of today s cryptocurrencies cryptocurrencies are creating new money and unlike credit markets which only pretend to expand the money supply by lending it out 10x with fractional reserve lending cryptocurrencies are literally printing money and they aren t loaning it to people they re giving it to them for their service to the network  it s like microloans without the loans  as naval said  society gives you money for giving society what it wants blockchains give you coins for giving the network what it wants   so instead of giving all the money to a small group of miners what if we could do better a lot better  we can  i outlined one way in the an article about the cicada project how we deliver a universal basic income right now and save ourselves from the robots the cicada design flips the idea of mining on its head everyone on the network is a miner and nobody can have more than one miner  miners are drafted randomly to keep the network running smoothly you might be walking along getting coffee and your phone gets called on to secure the network for a few minutes after that it goes right back to sleep as a reward you might win new coins for doing nothing but having the application on your phone simple right  because everyone is eventually drafted everyone gets paid in essence creating a ubi right now  and that s just one way  if you think about it you can come up with dozens oh and don t get caught up with thinking the only way to do this is with an id lots of ways to randomly draft miners without that too the key is to free your mind of the  satoshi box  and think different  what we really need is to completely gamify the delivery of money distributing it far and wide at the moment of creation    money is a game embrace it  give it out as rewards for using apps or as distributed mining fees or as shared cuts of the mining fees to organizations that provide value to the network are just a few more ways to do it right those are just the tip of the iceberg there are thousands of ways but we just haven t been thinking about the problem the right way  in other words we missed the real power of satoshi s creation the distribution of money  the first system that truly gamifies the delivery of money will rocket to exponential growth upending the current system for good that will set the initial playing field dynamically and allow players who never would have gotten into the game to compete the more people who can participate the more efficient and valuable the network becomes   networks have  network effects  adding a new participant increases the value of the network for all existing participants   right now we re not adding new participants fast enough to the cryptonets of tomorrow the system is still vulnerable to the violence hack gamified money is the answer to exponential growth  if the system can grow large enough fast enough it will become an unstoppable juggernaut and the rest of the economic universe will need to come over to the new playing field  once the amazons and google s of the world join the playing field their selfpreservation instinct will kick in and they ll want to protect and expand it and this new network will behave differently instead of rewarding just the people at the top who ve been rigging the rules in their favor since the beginning of time the game will completely reset with a new set of rules  what s best for the whole network not just the few players at the top is best   blockchains are a new invention that allows meritorious participants in an open network to govern without a ruler and without money they are meritbased tamperproof open voting systems the meritorious are those who work to advance the network blockchains  open and merit based markets can replace networks previously run by kings corporations aristocracies and mobs   those that join the network and help it grow will thrive and flourish with it it will amplify their own value making it grow faster than at any point in history every ounce they give to the system will magnify their own rewards  by contrast economies that stand against the network attempting to cripple it with arbitrary rules will pay a heavy price the system will stretch across the globe and only the most essential rules will take root because in order to upgrade a distributed system you need vast consensus across the network since people can generally only agree on big essential solutions no selfdefeating narrowminded rules will be allowed  let s say that a country decides to restrict icos to their citizens altogether or make cryptocurrencies illegal instead of killing the network the rules will blow back on their creators only their own people will suffer as they won t be able to participate in the explosion of new potential that icos bring to the table draining money out of the economy into rival economies even worse if they make cryptos illegal they ll simply drive that money underground which will keep them from getting tax from their citizens which will starve them of revenue  as the system spreads it will put people back in control of their own financial power no one will be able to take your money from you and that is a good thing    of course not everyone thinks so some folks always worry that people will do bad things with this power like commit crimes but people will always do bad things they do those things now and they always have crippling the system for everyone just to get those people is the height of insanity it has never worked and it never will  still some people will never believe that  they trust their central powers unquestioningly all you have to do is wrap up your argument in  protecting the children  or  fighting terrorism  and you can generally fool half of the people half of the time about any terrible policy you want  yet i ve found that people who see central systems as the answer to everything have usually lived in a stable central system for their whole lives  a few days in an unstable system would change their minds very quickly  don t believe me  imagine you lived in syria right now  your central infrastructure is destroyed as is your money you don t want the war but there s nothing you can do about it now your house is gone your friends and family are dead your banks are bombed out and you re cast out adrift homeless and penniless even worse nobody wants you the world has shifted from open borders to building walls everywhere you re not welcome anywhere you can t stay where you are and you re broke  but what if your money was still there recorded on the blockchain waiting for you to download and restore a deterministic wallet and give it the right passphrase to restore it  how much easier would it be to start your life over  cryptocurrencies finally offer a way for us to control our own destiny for the very first time in the history of the world we have a way to generate and distribute money without a central power people will have control over the money they rightfully earned  and even better instead of setting the playing field so the game is always rigged we can set the game up the way it was always meant to be played with open competition and flexible rules in a dynamic system that allows everyone to compete  but we need to think big we need to find a way to distribute the money far and wide without taking it from everyone else do that and we change the game forever  that s what my team is working on want to talk find us in decstackcom  centralized money is the ultimate chain  cut that chain and you free the world    ']"
